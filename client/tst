Travis County expects to get about $ 54 million but has not yet received it . The City 's $ 170.8 million is the equivalent of about 15.5 percent of the $ 1.1 billion general fund approved for the Fiscal Year 2019-2020 budget that pays for core services including public safety , parks , libraries , neighborhood health centers and the animal shelter . The CARES funds will help make up for coronavirus-caused shortfalls in budgeted revenue , including sales taxes and mixed beverage taxes , that 's already triggered a hiring freeze . City Public Information Manager Bryce Bencivengo told The Austin Bulldog the City is awaiting guidance from the Treasury Department on how these funds may be spent . `` This is specifically for local government relief to fund the city itself , '' Bencivengo said . `` It 's to fill revenue shortfalls . It could be used for the Paycheck Protection Plan for staff salaries and overtime and hotels used for isolation . '' Will these funds be used to cover gaps in the general fund ? `` We do n't know at this time , '' he said . `` I think there will be unplanned expenses in enterprise departments . They might not have face coverings , that could be an area , but at this point we do n't know except for direct expenditures . It 's still unclear if the money can be used for general fund or the larger organization . '' The CARES Act provides for payments to state , local , and tribal governments navigating the impact of the COVID-19 outbreak , according to the U.S. Treasury Department 's website . The City of Austin and Travis County are among the 171 eligible units of city and county local government which had a population of more than 500,000 people , according to a Treasury Department list . Eighteen of those are in Texas , including Williamson County . Travis County money coming too Travis County has not yet received its portion of funds from the CARES Act , said Diana Ramirez , Travis County director of economic development and strategic investments . Ramirez briefed the Commissioners Court April 14 , 2020 , and estimated that Travis County would receive $ 54 million `` for outside the city limits '' of Austin . `` We do n't have any guidance from Treasury on what we can spend the money on . '' This afternoon , Ramirez told The Austin Bulldog there is still no guidance . She said the county is figuring out where it has gaps in service and what money can be added to provide `` more capacity in existing programs that might make it easier to spend that money quickly , legally , and have the greatest impact on the community . '' `` At the end of the year the Treasury Department 's inspector general will review our documentation to be sure the money was spent right . We do n't want to wind up with any disallowed expenses . We have to balance getting the money in , getting the money out , and spending on areas the Treasury Department wants us to spend it on , '' Ramirez said . `` We 're making plans , seeing what the needs are in the community , and preparing our internal plans against the Treasury guidance so we can go the Commissioners Court and have them make the decision . '' City 's Bridge Loan program still not launched As reported April 9 , 2020 , the City of Austin received approval from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development to use some $ 5.7 million in Section 108 funds to make Economic Injury Bridge Loans to for-profit small businesses . The program would make loans of up to $ 35,000 for small businesses that had already applied for a loan from the U.S. Small Business Administration . The idea was to provide money to keep small businesses afloat while waiting for the SBA loans to come through . Plans called for launching the portal to accept applications beginning Monday April 13 if all went well . Today , a week later , the program is still not up and running . The City 's website for the program indicates `` Status Pending '' and `` Our staff has been working swiftly to build the infrastructure to support this new loan program . We are in the final stages of testing to ensure the application process is efficient and effective . '' In response to The Austin Bulldog 's follow-up query , Veronica Samo , a public information representative for the City 's Economic Development Department , said in an email , `` The team is still working to ensure the appropriate infrastructure is in place to process loan inquiries and loan applications , '' . `` All website information will be updated when the program is ready to launch , '' she said .

The federal assistance program , known as PPP , allows companies with fewer than 500 employees to obtain loans from banks to mostly cover payroll costs . If the firms retain employees and meet other requirements , the loans will be forgiven , paid off by taxpayers , The Washington Post reported . The first $ 349 billion in PPP funding was disbursed in less than two weeks when 1.6 million companies secured funding , the Post said . And while many companies were unable to obtain loans , some local companies were luckier . Mainstreet Community Bank of Florida , headquartered at 204 S. Woodland Blvd. , got $ 50 million for its business customers , and Surety Bank secured $ 3 million in funding from the program , officials with the two banks said . `` As of April 16 , we had received 498 completed PPP requests . We successfully submitted 389 totalling $ 50 -LSB- million -RSB- , prior to funding running out , '' said Ben Flowers , Mainstreet 's president and chief executive . `` We have approximately $ 10 -LSB- million -RSB- to submit -LSB- in -RSB- over 108 more loans . '' Flowers said those applications will be submitted once the additional federal funding is secured . `` That 's our plan , '' he said . `` We 've been working seriously on getting ready to submit all we 've approved , as well as other applications we 've received since April 16 . '' In a very rough estimate , Flowers guesses the approved loans may save as many as 5,000 jobs . Ryan James , CEO of Surety Bank at 990 N. Woodland Blvd. , said in a news release that the $ 10 million secured for Surety 's customers will probably save more than 360 local jobs . `` We are thankful to be able to assist our community 's local businesses during these trying times , '' James said in the news release . `` These are not just names on a loan application , but these are our friends and neighbors . '' One business benefiting from the PPP loan through Surety is the DeLand Fish House , which has been closed since March 22 , the release says . `` We are grateful to our committed team of servers and staff here at our restaurant , '' Nicholas Costa , owner of the DeLand Fish House , said in the release . `` With Surety Bank 's assistance , this loan will help our team and their families get through this challenging time until we can once again open our doors to serve our beloved customers inside our restaurant . '' Getting PPP funding through Mainstreet Bank was Melisa Reed , who with her husband , Dan , owns several businesses in DeLand and Southeast Volusia . However , only The Table , their restaurant in Downtown DeLand , was able to get PPP funding , she told The Beacon . Since applicants have to apply through a bank with which they have a banking relationship , and The Table is the only business the Reeds own that banks with Mainstreet , they were able to get money that will help the restaurant 's 42 employees , Reed said . But the couple did n't get loans for their other businesses -- Cafe DaVinci and Neighbors Tacos -LRB- which they co-own with Robbie Carelli and Andy Sistrunk of Persimmon Hollow Brewing Co. -RRB- on West Georgia Avenue , The Boulevard cocktail bar on North Woodland Boulevard , the Inn Between restaurant on Old New York Avenue , and two e-cig stores in Edgewater and New Smyrna Beach .

There is n't much mystery surrounding the Cincinnati Bengals ' first overall selection . A report from Fox 's Jeremy Rauch indicated that the team has informed Joe Burrow he will be in stripes . After that , however , what the Bengals decide to do is anybody 's guess . Or is it ? Perhaps looking at the front office 's tendencies over the past 10 years could give fans a clue of what to expect . Thanks to Vivid Seats , we have that information available to us . When it comes to the second round , there could be any number of positions that offer good value . Based on historical actions , a wide receiver seems to be the most likely position the Bengals attack . The team has drafted 14 wideouts since 2010 , with the corner and linebacker units commanding the second most draft capital at 12 and 10 picks , respectively . For those who are hoping the Bengals secure Burrow some extra protection , there 's hope for that scenario as well . The front office has used 7 picks on guards , 5 on tackles , and 4 on centers . If you 'd rather categorize the three under one offensive line group , that would make the unit the most drafted . Moving on to the Bengals college conference preference , the SEC seems to run supreme for those who run the operation in Cincinnati . The team has spent a whopping 22 picks -LRB- 23.6 % of their draft capital over the past decade -RRB- on players reigning from the south , with the next closest conference being the BIG-12 at 16 . Duke Tobin and company seem to have a particular affinity for players from Georgia , calling the names of 5 prospects from the school , the most out of any college . The data also seems to suggest there may be a location bias in the Bengals war room . The Ohio State Buckeyes have 5 players who have exchanged the scarlet and grey for the orange and black , giving the Georgia Bulldogs a run for their money . For the fans who just ca n't wait to see who the next player to don a Bengals jersey will be , statistics like these can help predict just what conversations are being held in the team 's virtual meetings .", "url": "https://stripehype.com/2020/04/22/draft-tendencies-suggest-bengals-protection-burrow/", "kws": ["Bengals", "Cincinnati^^Bengals", "Joe^^Burrow", "Cincinnati", "Joe", "Georgia^^Bulldogs", "Jeremy^^Rauch", "stripes", "Duke^^Tobin", "guards", "statistics", "hope", "Vivid^^Seats", "historical^^actions", "front^^office"], "text_category": {"first_cat": {"Sports": 1.0000096559524536}, "second_cat": {"Sports_Football": 1.0000096559524536}, "third_cat": {"Sports_Football_Other": 1.0000096559524536}}, "ne_content_person": {"Joe Burrow": 1, "Jeremy Rauch": 1, "Duke Tobin": 1, "Fox": 1}, "src": "stripehype.com", "c_word": 432, "para_count": 9.0, "para_length": 48.0, "image_count": 1, "geotag": [{"name": "cincinnati", "score": 0.9760534167289734, "coord": "39.103118,-84.512020", "pid": "cincinnati,ohio", "type": "city"}], "title_c_count": 10}

While Matt LaFelur insists that does not mean Aaron Rodgers is on borrowed time with the team , at least one longtime Packers reporter believes the head coach was sending Rodgers a message with the pick . Bob McGinn , who has covered the Packers for roughly 40 years , was highly critical of the team 's draft in his latest column for The Athletic . While he 's not sold on Jordan Love as an NFL prospect , McGinn thinks it is fair to wonder if the Packers will want to get out from under Rodgers ' contract in the next year or two if he does n't rediscover his MVP form or something close to it . The Packers took former Boston College star running back AJ Dillon in the second round and declined to use none of their eight picks on a wide receiver , which has led to increased speculation that they could look to become more of a running team next season . A change in philosophy like that might not sit well with Rodgers , which is why McGinn believes the decision to trade up to No. 26 for Love indicates LaFleur has `` simply had enough of Rodgers ' act and wanted to change the narrative . '' If Love succeeds in his first NFL offseason , that could put pressure on Rodgers in one of two ways . For one , it might inspire the 36-year-old to check his ego if he feels like a youngster is breathing down his neck . Or , better yet for the Packers , Love 's presence could light a fire under Rodgers and create a situation similar to the one when the New England Patriots used a second-round pick on Jimmy Garoppolo back in 2014 . Tom Brady went on to lead the Pats to three more Super Bowl wins after that , and there 's no question the team 's decision to draft Garoppolo motivated him . If the Packers viewed Love as a long-term backup and nothing more , there 's no way they would have traded up and used a first-round pick on him . Rodgers appears to be taking the addition of Love in stride , but the situation will be one to monitor -- especially if it creates tension between Rodgers and LaFleur .", "url": "https://larrybrownsports.com/football/matt-lafleur-send-message-aaron-rodgers-with-jordan-love-pick/548471", "kws": ["Aaron^^Rodgers", "Matt^^LaFleur", "quarterback^^Jordan^^Love", "Matt^^LaFelur", "Jordan", "quarterback", "Tom^^Brady", "the^^Packers", "AJ^^Dillon", "NFL^^Draft", "Pats", "Bob^^McGinn", "Bob", "running", "Jimmy^^Garoppolo", "Love", "star", "Green^^Bay", "message", "stride"], "text_category": {"first_cat": {"Sports": 1.0000100135803223}, "second_cat": {"Sports_Football": 1.0000100135803223}, "third_cat": {"Sports_Football_NFL": 1.0}}, "ne_content_person": {"Garoppolo": 1, "Jimmy Garoppolo": 1, "McGinn": 2, "Jordan Love": 1, "Matt LaFelur": 1, "Tom Brady": 1, "AJ Dillon": 1, "LaFleur": 2, "Aaron Rodgers": 1, "Rodgers": 8, "Bob McGinn": 1}, "src": "Larry Brown Sports", "c_word": 424, "para_count": 5.0, "para_length": 84.8, "image_count": 1, "geotag": [], "title_c_count": 14}

But How Many Children He Has In Total Remains A Mystery", "content": "TOPLINE British Prime Minister Boris Johnson welcomed a baby boy with his fiancée , Carrie Symonds , Wednesday morning at a London hospital -- the latest addition to the Johnson family , the exact size of which the prime minister has tried to keep private from the British public . KEY FACTS Johnson has four children with ex-wife Marina Wheeler , a lawyer whom he divorced earlier this year after they separated in 2018 . The Prime Minister also has a fifth child , with art consultant Helen Macintyre , from an affair while Johnson was London 's mayor ; though Macintyre attempted to keep the details of her daughter 's paternity private , appeals court judges ruled in 2013 that the public had a right to know about the extramarital liaison that produced the child . Documents from those proceedings hint at allegations that Macintyre 's child with Johnson may be only one of two children Johnson had as a result of affairs . Johnson has been fiercely guarded about the exact number of children he has fathered and their identities ; during his 2019 campaign , he answered questions about how many he has by saying , `` I love my children very much , but they are not standing at this election , '' and `` I 'm not therefore going to comment on them . '' Johnson -- previously referred to as `` Bonking Boris '' by some British tabloids -- has led a complex private life , with two divorces under his belt and multiple rumored extramarital affairs . KEY BACKGROUND As for Johnson 's latest child , both mother and baby are reported to `` be doing very well , '' although it was not revealed at which London hospital the baby boy was born , his name or his birth weight . Previously , it was reported the baby would be born in early summer , but Johnson 's spokesperson would not say if the son was premature . On Monday , Johnson returned to work at Downing Street for the first time since spending three nights in intensive care being treated for coronavirus . Symonds , a former Conservative Party official , isolated herself after showing symptoms . Johnson will reportedly take paternity leave later this year .

On Tuesday , Gov. Charlie Baker extended the closure of all non-essential businesses , including golf courses , until at least May 18 due to the coronavirus pandemic . Courses across the Bay State have been deserted since the beginning of the outbreak in March and they will remain empty for at least two-and-a-half more weeks . Jesse Menachem , executive director of Mass. . Golf , says he has been taking endless phone calls from golfers who are anxious to hit the links and get their seasons underway . `` We feel we can be compared to hiking , to biking , and to walking that 's currently allowed , and give residents of Massachusetts another outlet to exercise and be healthy , '' said Menachem , whose non-profit organization has more than 85,000 members . Menachem wants Baker to reopen golf courses before May 18 . He feels the game can be played safely with social distancing practices that are being followed in other states where golf is permitted . Menachem says golfers can pay online , refrain from congregating before and after rounds , and wait longer between tee times . : Coronavirus hospitalizations not falling at ` consistent rate , ' moving too quick could ` create another outbreak ' `` We also suggest if carts are permitted , they are restricted to one golfer per golf cart , '' Menachem said . Baker pondered the idea of opening golf courses to walkers on Wednesday but stopped short of giving the green light to golfers . `` I 'm going to try to leave most of the decisions of safe openings to the work that 's being done by the reopening advisory board , '' Baker said during a news conference on the State House . Menachem says he knows for a fact that Bay State golfers are filling out tee sheets in Connecticut and New York . `` If we can open up golf courses in Massachusetts , it 's going to avoid that and allow our businesses to thrive , and allow people to stay safe within our borders , '' Menachem said .

Implemented properly , this practice can help reduce the spread of some viruses and food-borne pathogens . However , media messaging and terminology about this topic is not always clear . An increase in calls to poison control centers between January and March suggests fear of bringing the COVID-19 virus into the home has led to unsafe practices around cleaning , sanitizing and disinfecting . The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention , National Poison Data System and American Association of Poison Control Centers compared the number of chemical exposures reported during this time to the previous two years . The comparison found a significant increase in calls related to cleaning and sanitizing chemical exposure , 20.4 % and 16.4 % , respectively . While the increase can not be definitively associated with changes in cleaning and sanitizing practices , the potential association warrants reiteration of proper procedures . Safely store chemicals , including hand sanitizers , away from food , ensure accurate labeling and lock up products if children are in the home . Clean , sanitize and disinfect are words used interchangeably , but their meaning and intended uses are very different : Cleaning describes the process of using soap and clean water to remove particles from a surface . Sanitizing uses a diluted , Environmental Protection Agency-approved chemical to significantly reduce pathogens.Disinfecting uses a concentrated EPA-approved chemical to kill most pathogens and is generally not intended for food-contact surfaces . The correct process is as follows : Clean with soap and water to remove particles . Sanitizers lose effectiveness when applied to soiled surfaces . Next , rinse soap with fresh water . Soap residues inactivate sanitizers . Finally , apply a sanitizing chemical , mixed according to product instructions and allow to sit for recommended time.In the kitchen , sanitizing -LRB- versus disinfecting -RRB- is a safe practice , so long as the chemical used specifically states `` safe for food-contact surfaces . '' The practice of using highly concentrated chemicals , not intended for food-contact surfaces , to disinfect kitchen counters and food preparation tools can result in cross-contamination . In essence , your food becomes poisoned with chemicals . If the need arises to disinfect your kitchen , you must follow up with the clean , rinse and sanitize procedure to remove excess chemicals .

This study will harness the dog 's extraordinary ability to support the nation 's COVID-19 surveillance systems , with the goal of reducing community spread . '' Preliminary screening of live humans by trained dogs could begin as early as July , Penn Vets says . Eight dogs will undergo a process called `` odor imprinting '' for three weeks . The dogs will be exposed to positive COVID-19 saliva and urine samples inside the lab . `` Once the dogs learn the odor , the investigators will document that the dogs can discriminate between COVID-19 positive and COVID-19 negative samples in a laboratory setting , establishing the platform for testing to determine if the dogs can identify COVID-19 infected people , '' Penn Vet says .

Ricardo Vaz Te scores an 87th minute winner against Blackpool in the Football League Championship Play Off Final at Wembley on 19th May 2012 to secure promotion to the Premier League . During the build up to the 2012 London Olympics , where the Olympic Stadium was to eventually become the home ground for the Hammers , West Ham United guided by Sam Allardyce , had overcome Cardiff City in the two legged play offs to secure their place in the final after ending the season in 3rd place , just 2 points behind Southampton in 2nd place and 3 points behind Champions Reading . Allardyce signed a 2 year contract on 1st June 2011 on the back of West Ham 's relegation from the Premier League , and he vowed to play attractive football in the traditions of West Ham , denying claims that his teams played dull , long ball football . Sam certainly made some key signings bringing in Nolan , Diop , O'Brien , McCartney , Baldock and Carew but it was n't until the Winter transfer window that Allardyce secured Vaz Te , along with Ravel Morrison . Over the course of the season , 25 players left the club and 19 new players were signed . Born on 1st October 1986 , Portuguese Vaz Te went on to score 19 goals in 61 appearances for West Ham , including a goal on 21st February 2012 in a 4-1 win against Blackpool . Vaz Te transferred to Turkish side Akhisar Belediyespor during the Winter transfer window of 2015 , after making only 5 first team appearances under Allardyce . Blackpool came in to the final on the back of a good run of results in the league , but Carlton Cole put the Hammers in front on 35 minute to see the team go into half time with the advantage . Then in 48th minute , Thomas Ince , son of former Hammers midfielder Paul , equalised and set up an exciting end to the second half with both teams stretched in an end to end match as they trying to secure the winner . Both teams had wasted good opportunities to score the winner with Blackpool 's Dobbie missing a brilliant chance from 14 yards when completely unmarked and Hammers skipper Kevin Nolan 's excellent volley crashing against the woodwork . It looked as if the game would go to extra time until the 87th minute when the unmarked Ricardo drilled the ball into the net from 12 yards after it had slipped out of Blackpool keeper Gilks ' hands with Vaz Te in the right place to break the Seasiders hearts and secure # 50m promotion back into the Premier League . The first team since Leicester in 1996 to bounce straight back into the Premier League through the play off finals . I chose this photo just as the ball had gone into the net and Vaz Te is about to remove his shirt and celebrate what would prove to be a crucial victory . You can see how gutted Gilks is . Given the time of the goal , despite some close efforts , surely he must know thats the game lost .", "url": "https://www.westhamtillidie.com/posts/2020/04/30/through-the-lens-photographs-from-hammers-history-part-5-2012-championship-play-off-final", "kws": ["Hammers", "Premier^^League", "Football^^League", "Leicester", "Southampton", "West^^Ham^^United", "Champions^^Reading", "Olympic^^Stadium", "Sam^^Allardyce", "Wembley", "Cardiff^^City", "Blackpool", "home", "Portuguese^^Vaz^^Te", "Baldock", "48th^^minute", "Akhisar^^Belediyespor", "attractive^^football", "Carlton^^Cole", "Gilks"], "text_category": {"first_cat": {"Sports": 0.9996880292892456}, "second_cat": {"Sports_Soccer": 0.9996880292892456}, "third_cat": {"Sports_Soccer_Other": 0.9996880292892456}}, "ne_content_person": {"McCartney": 1, "Baldock": 1, "Ricardo": 1, "Diop": 1, "Akhisar Belediyespor": 1, "Carlton Cole": 1, "Gilks": 1, "Vaz Te": 3, "Paul": 1, "Vaz": 1, "Thomas Ince": 1, "Kevin Nolan": 1, "Allardyce": 3, "Dobbie": 1, "Ricardo Vaz": 1, "Ravel Morrison": 1, "O'Brien": 1, "Carew": 1, "Sam Allardyce": 1, "Sam": 1}, "src": "westhamtillidie.com", "c_word": 552, "para_count": 10.0, "para_length": 55.2, "image_count": 1, "geotag": [], "title_c_count": 15}

Six crew were aboard the helicopter when it disappeared , the officer said on condition of anonymity . NATO declined to give details , noting that information `` will be released in accordance with national procedures '' . The Canadian Armed Forces -LRB- CAF -RRB- have not said so far how many personnel were on board . Greek public television earlier reported that a body had been found amid the wreckage in international waters off the Greek island of Kefalonia . But the Greek military officer did not immediately confirm a body had been found . CAF have not confirmed that any debris has been found , but said on Twitter it contacted the family members of those who were on board the missing helicopter . The aircraft was `` involved in an accident in the Mediterranean Sea '' , it said , but gave no other details . CAF issued a statement earlier saying it had lost contact with the helicopter deployed on board HMCS Fredericton , which was participating in NATO exercises off the coast of Greece . `` Search and rescue efforts are currently under way , '' it added . Juanita Chang , spokeswoman for Supreme Headquarters Allied Powers Europe -LRB- SHAPE -RRB- , said NATO ships and air assets were taking part in the search , supported by maritime and air components from Greece , Italy , Turkey and the United States . Initial reports said the helicopter had been over international waters 50 nautical miles -LRB- 93 kilometers -RRB- off Kefalonia . Italian , Greek and Turkish frigates were taking part in the exercises along with the Canadians .

The folks at XDA Developers have discovered a 3D render of a ` Deep Blue ' Galaxy Buds + in version 1.7.47-22 of Samsung 's SmartThings app . The ` Deep Blue ' moniker is also mentioned in the app , suggesting that the company is already working on the new color variant of the earbuds . The Galaxy Buds + were initially launched in Cosmic Black , Cloud Blue , and white colors back in February . Last month , Samsung introduced the buds in two new colors : pink and red , taking the total to five . Their availability may vary from market to market though , with the company limiting some color variants to certain markets . Samsung also has a special edition Galaxy Buds + : the Thom Browne Edition . This package includes a Galaxy Z Flip with leather covers , a pair of Galaxy Buds + , and the Galaxy Watch Active 2 in a special paint job . Samsung working on Deep Blue Galaxy Buds + Now , Samsung appears to be gearing up to add a sixth color option for the Galaxy Buds + . This time , it 's a much darker blue color than the one already available . However , the 3D video renders available in the Samsung SmartThings app likely only show the tentative shade . The actual color of the product may slightly differ from what you can see in the images below . Design-wise , it 's the same Galaxy Buds + that launched with the Galaxy S20 and the Galaxy Z Flip earlier in February . So expect only a new paint job . You 're still getting AKG-tuned audio , up to 22 hours of playback time , and much more at $ 149.99 , though . The Galaxy Buds + feature 2-way dynamic speakers -LRB- 1 woofer + 1 tweeter -RRB- for better sound . Each bud also has three microphones . The Buds + further come with Spotify integration , meaning a single tap can get you your favorite tracks on the streaming app . It 's unclear when the company plans to launch the new Deep Blue Galaxy Buds + . While this appearance in the SmartThings app does n't guarantee that the Deep Blue Galaxy Buds + will see the light of day , it 's quite likely that they will , at least in select markets . Samsung might quietly release them in some markets in the near future . Samsung is already working on the next generation of its truly wireless earbuds . The buds , which are likely to be called Galaxy BudsX , are being developed with codename `` Bean '' and model number SM-R180 . These buds are expected to launch in August , alongside the Galaxy Note 20 and the Galaxy Fold 2 .", "url": "https://www.androidheadlines.com/2020/04/samsung-galaxy-buds-spotted-deep-blue-color.html", "kws": ["Galaxy^^Buds", "Samsung^^Galaxy", "Galaxy^^BudsX", "Color", "white^^colors", "pink", "Cloud^^Blue", "leather^^covers", "2-way^^dynamic^^speakers", "model^^number^^SM-R180", "XDA^^Developers", "AKG-tuned^^audio", "select^^markets", "Cloud", "Spotify^^integration", "Developers", "company", "market"], "text_category": {"first_cat": {"TechnologyElectronics": 1.0000100135803223}, "second_cat": {"TechnologyElectronics_Computers": 1.0000100135803223, "TechnologyElectronics_Internet": 0.9998465776443481}}, "ne_content_person": {}, "src": "Android Headlines", "c_word": 494, "para_count": 13.0, "para_length": 38.0, "image_count": 2, "geotag": [], "title_c_count": 11}

The incident `` did not impact Secret Service protective operations , '' a spokeswoman for the agency said . `` The Secret Service is working with appropriate partner law enforcement agencies to investigate the incident . '' The United States formally re-established diplomatic relations with Cuba in 2015 under the Obama administration . At the time , President Barack Obama had declared that the two nations were ready to reopen embassies in each others 's capitals and start a `` new chapter '' of engagement after more than 50 years of estrangement . The embassy openings were the culmination of months of negotiations to overcome decades of enmity . In recent years , there have been several incidents at embassies and consulates on American soil . In 2014 , a fire was set at the main entrance of Chinese Consulate General in San Francisco , causing significant damage to the doors and charring part of the exterior . And in 2019 , a group of American activists moved into the five-story Venezuelan Embassy in Washington to demonstrate against potential U.S. military intervention .", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/30/us/cuban-embassy-shooting.html", "kws": ["Cuban^^Embassy", "Cuban^^officials", "Venezuelan^^Embassy", "U.S.^^authorities", "police", "Washington", "authorities", "incident", "Chinese^^Consulate^^General", "Cuba", "embassies", "American^^activists", "Texas", "diplomatic^^relations", "Man", "President^^Barack^^Obama", "Fire", "assault", "shooting", "Foreign^^Affairs"], "text_category": {"first_cat": {"CrimePublicsafety": 0.9988806843757629}, "second_cat": {"CrimePublicsafety_Other": 0.9988806843757629}}, "ne_content_person": {"Barack Obama": 1, "Brianna Jordan": 1, "Jordan": 1, "Obama": 1, "Alexander Alazo": 1}, "src": "New York Times", "c_word": 576, "para_count": 12.0, "para_length": 48.0, "image_count": 1, "geotag": [{"name": "washington", "score": 0.5430778861045837, "coord": "38.907192,-77.036871", "pid": "washington,district_of_columbia", "type": "city"}, {"name": "Texas", "score": 1.0, "pid": "texas", "type": "state"}, {"name": "Washington", "score": 1.0, "pid": "washington", "type": "state"}], "title_c_count": 13}

That became clear in mid-March when he , like thousands of other New Yorkers , saw his income dry up during the economic slowdown triggered by the ongoing coronavirus pandemic . Stultz is a real estate agent at EXR , with spring typically the beginning of his busy season . But nobody is buying property in the middle of a pandemic , and the only way he can show apartments right now is virtually , which he says is effectively impossible . `` A year ago at this time I was making $ 10,000 a month , '' he says . `` This made it impossible for someone like me to work . '' As those realities began to bear down on Stultz , he hooked up with a friend , Matthew Clifford , whose Williamsburg restaurant , Grilled Cheese Alley , was shuttered by Gov. Andrew Cuomo 's statewide stay-at-home order . The pair pooled their fears and anger , and decided that something needed to be done . Together , they now administer a Facebook group called ACTION : New York City Rent Strike , a loose alliance of New Yorkers who 've had their income disrupted as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic , and are demanding comprehensive rent relief from both their landlords and City Hall . Through ACTION , an aggrieved tenant can find petitions , phone banks , and a DIY poster-crafting guide that 's perfect for sparking an insurrection from the laundry room . I first interviewed Stultz on March 31 , a day before his rent strike became a reality . He was already gearing up for a revolution . `` We 're not really playing around with nuance right now , '' he said . `` We 're letting the world know what we need , and hopefully somebody is going to pick up the slack and realize it 's a really dire situation . I do n't know if it 's going to be city , state , or federal , but it has to be one of the three . '' Cuomo has yet to commit to any far-reaching rent nullification , and believes the 90-day eviction moratorium that the state passed on March 20 served as a sufficient answer to tenant concerns . `` Even the people to whom you pay the rent have to pay the rent , '' he recently said . Members of ACTION believe that the moratorium does n't go nearly far enough , and have thrown their support behind Senate Bill S8125A , sponsored by state Sens. Michael Gianaris and Julia Salazar , which would cancel rent payments for certain residents and small businesses for the next three months . It remains to be seen when , or if , that bill will gain traction in Albany . For now , New York City 's rent strike movement is hyperlocal ; tenants are moving door by door to organize their buildings , with the hope that collective action might force their landlords ' hand -- and that , eventually , those property owners will force the government into compliance . Alexz Graves is one of those tenants ; she works as a TV producer , her husband in fabrication , and they share an apartment in Bushwick . She remembers telling her family that she 'd been laid off while getting a haircut . She was going to be fine , she insisted , as long as her husband kept his job . `` I kid you not , I got home after the haircut and my husband said , ` I got laid off , ''' she said . `` We just sat there . What are we going to do ? '' After joining ACTION , Graves drafted up a letter to inform her fellow tenants that she and her husband did n't plan on paying rent , urging them to do the same , and slipped copies under the doors of each apartment in her 15-unit building . `` I just got super involved and super diligent , '' said Graves . `` I want to get as many people involved as possible . '' It 's never easy to organize a rent strike , but to do so during a pandemic , where even the mildest person-to-person interaction is rendered a deadly taboo , is even more difficult . -LRB- Graves added a disclaimer to her letters : `` All hands have been washed and sanitized before handling these letters . '' -RRB- To get tenants on the same page , Graves created a private Facebook page for her building , which has done a decent job of replicating the outreach she would typically do in person . Graves says the demographic of her building skews young and digitally literate , but when I interviewed her on April 1 , only four of the 15 units had responded to her initial canvassing . The Facebook page had n't fared much better . `` I 'm starting to realize that there are n't as many people tuned into this , or know what 's going on , '' she said . `` It was shocking to me , honestly . Not being able to rally people in person has been the main challenge for me . '' John , a Bushwick resident leading a rent strike initiative in his building -LRB- and who asked to withhold his last name -RRB- , echoed some of Graves 's frustrations . I first spoke to him on March 31 , one day after he organized a Zoom call with some of the occupants of his building . The goal was to settle on a plan for April , but it was difficult to reach a clear consensus . Some tenants supported the idea of withholding rent until the April 10 late-fee deadline to send a message to management , while others wanted to send a signed letter of intent to the landlord , explaining that those who are able to pay rent will continue to do so only if those who have been laid off receive some form of financial support . In general , John said he was disappointed by the lack of unification with his fellow tenants . `` This is a moment where a lot of people who spent the last three or four years tweeting ` Donald Drumpf ' or whatever could make a difference , '' he said . `` Unsurprisingly , they 've not been willing to do anything . '' While awareness of the broader rent strike movement may not have been high a month or so ago , that 's slowly changing . Tenants ' rights groups like New York Communities for Change and Housing Justice For All have stumped for a state-wide rent strike . To consolidate that momentum , Housing Justice For All issued a 32-page pamphlet detailing the societal precedent for a rent strike , along with a step-by-step guide on how to organize your building . It remains to be seen how influential those calls to action will be toward building a big-tent housing movement , but Cea Weaver , the organization 's campaign coordinator , is n't sure how important that is . Already , she 's witnessed rent strike rhetoric enter the mainstream . `` If people want our resources , our resources are there . I 'd encourage people to use them , and our messaging , '' she says . `` But the fact that millions of people are uniting in their inability to pay rent and are calling out for action is the most important thing . The scale of absorption has dramatically changed . '' Two weeks after the initial round of interviews , I checked in with each of the people I spoke to for this story to see how their rent strike has progressed , and if their efforts were bearing fruit . John and his building did eventually settle on a plan : He , and others who could afford it , paid their rent on April 1 . They made the decision after realizing that there was n't yet a citywide plan of action for tenants in place . Now , he has his sights set on May , and his building 's `` tenants ' council '' -- an informal group of residents who are the most engaged -- already sent a note to management to make their intentions to strike clear . John described the contents of the letter as a `` soft ask '' : an appeal to the landlord 's mercy , with plans to ramp up the intensity if they demurred . Within 20 minutes , John received his response . `` It was from some guy in management who was like , ` We will reach out to all tenants individually , but we can not offer rent relief , we have bills to pay , ''' he says . But John is undeterred . His building is asking for a 30 percent rent reduction for June , July , and August ; if the landlord does n't meet those demands , the strike will persist . Graves and her husband have not paid April rent , and have no plans to pay in May . Despite that , she `` has n't heard a word '' from her landlord in the intervening weeks . She 's spoken to almost half of the tenants in her building , and four units have confirmed that they are n't paying rent . `` We feel okay , we feel protected right now , '' she says . `` But how long is that going to last ? That 's what scares me . '' Eventually , Graves hopes that the magnitude of laid-off New Yorkers will make the rent strike a much less radical idea . `` We ca n't just ignore it , '' says Graves . `` There will need to be some sort of legislation put in place . It wo n't be tonight , or this month , but the deeper we get into this , the more people in power will be forced to do something . '' Like the others , Stultz says that he 's yet to witness a fully centralized , unified rent strike movement in the city . But he feels more optimistic than ever one month into this new reality ; it 's inevitable , he contends , that ACTION is going to win . `` If you told me two months ago that I would be spouting ideas like this , I 'd tell you you were full of shit , '' Stultz says . `` But anyone I engage with on this issue agrees that we 're only asking for help because we 're told we ca n't work . All of us , whether we 're bartenders or performers , we all want to get back to our jobs . Rent relief has to happen , so I 'm positive about it .

We must ensure that people can access basic food supplies , but also that they have money to purchase them Mari Pangestu is the World Bank 's Managing Director for Development Policy and Partnerships and former Minister of Trade of Indonesia . Amid much terrible news tied to COVID-19 comes one positive forecast : world agricultural commodity prices are stable and are expected to remain so in 2020 , as production levels and stocks of most staple foods are at or near record highs . The World Bank 's Commodity Markets Outlook comes with large caveats including uncertainty over the pandemic 's duration and severity ; the direction of energy and fertilizer prices ; currency movements ; changes to trade and domestic support policies ; and possible disruptions in global supply chains . At a regional level , the worst locust outbreak in decades has hit 23 countries in Africa , the Arabian Peninsula and South Asia , devastating crops on which millions depend . Mitigating these risks requires concerted action . Rice prices trended upward in recent weeks due to drought conditions prior to COVID-19 and limiting trade measures , but came down in recent days thanks to the efforts of countries like Vietnam -- the world 's third-largest rice exporter -- which lifted its temporary export ban . This matters not only because a large share of rice consumed in Africa is imported , but also because past experience shows export restrictions can lead to rapid escalations in world food prices that affect poor countries the most . This was the case during the 2007/2008 food price crisis , when as many as one-third of the world 's countries adopted trade restrictions and the number of poor people increased by 150 million . It remains crucial to be vigilant which is why the World Bank joined G20 agricultural ministers and called on policymakers to refrain from imposing export restrictions . The message is resonating , with countries of the G20 , Latin America and the Caribbean , African Union and ASEAN all signaling their positive intentions . The world is facing unprecedented challenges today that require urgent , country-specific responses . Hunger has remained shockingly prevalent in recent years . According to the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization , 820 million people were already undernourished before today 's crisis -- including 135 million people experiencing acute food insecurity . As incomes fall , we are already hearing reports of people skipping meals . This wave of malnutrition will have long-lasting impacts on human capital , especially for children . There are plenty of new obstacles to food production , transport and consumption . Pests and disease outbreaks such as locusts and African Swine Fever as well as droughts compound the COVID-19 challenge , prompting the World Food Program to predict a doubling of acute food insecurity by the end of the year . To understand the magnitude of the challenge , we need to look at the food supply chain and assess constraints at the country and local level . Farmers must be able to plant and harvest . They need access to and financing for inputs like fertilizer and seeds . They will also need labor resources . Measures to stop the spread of coronavirus are impeding the movement of migrants who perform farm work in many countries . Allowing worker movement , enforcing new safety protocols , and supplying workers with adequate protection will be critical in the months ahead . This is important in developing countries where agricultural production is more labor intensive , morbidity and movement restrictions can have larger impacts . Produce needs to reach the market . Food and related inputs and services need to be defined as essential goods so transport is prioritized to overcome the strictures of lockdowns . Truckers need more than a green light to keep working . They need mechanics and related services to keep delivering food to markets . The same goes for agricultural inputs . The continued flow of seeds , fertilizer and mechanical parts -- often across borders -- will be crucial in the next six to 12 months . And we need to recognize the myriad of businesses including small and medium enterprises , often informal , that supply farmers and handle food from farm to fork , and devise policies to keep them afloat . It 's important to not only ensure people access basic food supplies , but also that they have money to purchase them . On average , food accounts for up to 60 percent of household expenditures in low income countries and 40 percent in emerging and development market economies . Economic recession and loss of livelihoods quickly erode the food security of millions of people -- especially if food prices increase . The World Bank estimates that 40 to 60 million more people will be living in extreme poverty in coming months , depending on the scale of the economic shock . Therefore , social safety nets for the poorest and most vulnerable are needed as part of the immediate and next phase of COVID-19 emergency assistance . Many countries are using social safety nets to respond . However , much more needs to be done to compensate income losses and support businesses and promote economic resilience . In poorer countries , social safety nets and inclusion programs remain limited in budget , coverage , benefit levels and flexibility , and need to be significantly scaled up to respond to a crisis of this magnitude . Given the urgency of this challenge , countries ' limited resources , and that a large percentage of the labor force and informal sector are agricultural and food producers as well as net consumers -LRB- in some of the poorest countries up to 80 % -RRB- , it makes sense to prioritize agriculture and food sectors in designing assistance programs . This will mean we are putting money in people 's pockets so they do n't go hungry , and making sure food keeps moving .", "url": "https://news.trust.org/item/20200430125812-2c4jg", "kws": ["extreme^^poverty", "acute^^food^^insecurity", "domestic^^support^^policies", "larger^^impacts", "economic^^resilience", "Hunger", "poorer^^countries", "domestic^^support", "benefit^^levels", "long-lasting^^impacts", "livelihoods", "world^^food^^prices", "unprecedented^^challenges", "malnutrition", "Commodity^^Markets", "droughts", "supply^^farmers", "global^^supply^^chains", "human^^capital", "trade^^measures"], "text_category": {"first_cat": {"Society": 0.9999876022338867}, "second_cat": {"Society_Advocacy": 0.9999876022338867}, "third_cat": {"Society_Advocacy_Other": 0.9999876022338867}}, "ne_content_person": {"Mari Pangestu": 1}, "src": "trust.org", "c_word": 1036, "para_count": 16.0, "para_length": 64.75, "image_count": 1, "geotag": [], "title_c_count": 20}

'' The idea started with just wanting to make them for Eustis High School seniors . `` If I want to live in a nice place , I have to be one of the people making that happen , and I also can leverage the people in my community to help , '' Totten said . `` I get an idea . I go ask hundreds of people to help me and it turns out my community wants to be involved . '' Then , Totten got the city 's mayor involved . `` So , I started calling other city leaders and the excitement was unreal , '' said Eustis Mayor Michael Holland said . About 3,000 banners will be made , and Totten is footing the bill . `` It would be too hard to go ask everyone in this current economic climate to say , ` Hey you all need to pitch in some money , ' Totten said . `` So , those who can , can pitch in some money . '' Eustis plans to hang its banners up in its downtown . Other communities will pick where theirs go . `` Each of the students , they 're going to get their banner in the end , '' Totten said . `` So , they 'll have something to remember being honored in their town . '' The goal is to have all of the banners up by the middle of May so that they can stay up for the entire month of June .

Calipari or a UK assistant has since visited Chandler six times during the start of the fall recruiting period in September . Chandler returned the favor on an unofficial visit during the Wildcats ' 65-59 win over Florida at Rupp Arena on Feb. 22 , where he was joined by former Kentucky point guard and UK Athletics Hall of Famer and 5-time NBA All-Star John Wall . `` He talked to John Wall , who gave him some good advice as far as coming to Kentucky vs. other places , '' Chandler 's father , Kylan , told CatsPause.com .

The White House and senior officials with the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services -LRB- HHS -RRB- have communicated to us that they will immediately begin shipping large quantities of sample collection supplies to states and will be making weekly distributions for at least the months of May and June , with a commitment to help manage the domestic supply chain to ensure states ' continued access to supplies for the remainder of the year . They also indicated the federal government will consider opportunities to support the supply chain for our laboratories as well as assist with personnel challenges . `` In my conversations with the Trump administration , I have repeatedly emphasized the need for the federal government to create new sources of domestic production through use of the Defense Production Act -- not merely compete with states in the procurement of existing production . I am heartened by today 's commitment to do precisely that . We have been informed that Washington will receive more than 500,000 swabs each month as part of this new federal effort . `` This federal support is an important and welcome step toward a safe and responsible return to public life . However , additional forms of federal support for testing continue to be necessary , as I laid out in my letter to Vice President Pence last week . I continue to appreciate the open lines of communication with his office and others in the federal government , and I am hopeful we can keep working together in the coming days to ensure confidence in the laboratory supply chain and meet the full testing needs of vulnerable communities and workers across our state . `` I am grateful for the tireless efforts of Senator Patty Murray and others in Washington 's congressional delegation who have fought for weeks to secure the increased federal testing support we need at this critical time .

Indeed , it weighs in at just 230g , whereas the competing Sony 85mm f/1 .8 is about 50 per cent heavier , and the Zeiss Batis 85mm f/1 .8 is almost twice as heavy . JUMP TO : It should go without saying that a major attraction of ` compact system cameras ' is that they 're compact . But all too often , the bonus of a slim , lightweight body is overshadowed by chunky , heavyweight lenses . In the summer of 2017 , Samyang literally set about redressing the balance with the first of a ` tiny but almighty ' series of autofocus lenses for mirrorless cameras . For Sony E-mount bodies , the first of these was the AF 35mm f/2 .8 FE , which has since been followed by 18mm f/2 .8 , 24mm f/2 .8 and 45mm f/1 .8 lenses . The 75mm f/1 .8 is the latest in the line-up -- and as usual is marketed under both the Rokinon and Samyang brands -LRB- which you will find the more easily will depend on where you live in the world -RRB- . Specifications Names : Samyang AF 75mm f/1 .8 FE / Rokinon AF 75mm f/1 .8 FE Mount : Sony E -LRB- full-frame -RRB- Lens construction : 10 elements in 9 groups Angle of view : 32.9 degrees Diaphragm blades : 9 Minimum aperture : f/22 Minimum focusing distance : 0.69 m Maximum magnification ratio : 0.13 x Filter size : 58mm Dimensions : 65x69mm Weight : 230g Key features 75mm and 85mm prime lenses have an ideal focal length for portraiture and still life photography . They 're also highly useful whenever you need a short telephoto lens with a ` fast ' aperture rating , either for gaining a tight depth of field or for maintaining fast shutter speeds under low lighting conditions . It 's easy to get carried away with aperture ratings and there 's certainly a proliferation of f/1 .4 and even f/1 .2 prime lenses for mirrorless cameras on the market . However , they tend to be large , heavyweight optics that feel at odds with the mirrorless ethos . Samyang has gone with an f/1 .8 aperture as well as reducing the focal length from the more common 85mm to a more historically popular 75mm for this lens , both factors enabling a smaller , more lightweight build . The net result is a short telephoto prime that measures just 65x69mm and weighs a mere 230g . The filter thread is similarly small at 58mm . Even so , the lens packs in plenty of high-end attractions . The optical path comprises 10 elements which include no less than three ED -LRB- Extra-low Dispersion -RRB- elements and two HR -LRB- High Refractive index -RRB- elements . The overall aim is for high levels of sharpness , along with minimal colour fringing and distortion . Autofocus is courtesy of a linear stepping motor system , seeking to take advantage of the fast autofocus options in Sony 's latest mirrorless cameras , while also being near-silent in operation . As usual , it comes with an electronically coupled focus ring . Build and handling Although something of a featherweight , the Samyang feels solid and well-built . The metal mounting plate , high-quality barrel and plastic petal shaped lens hood are all perfectly durable , and the lens comes complete with a tight-fitting zippered case . The focus ring operates smoothly and , unlike with some stepping motor-driven lenses , it 's well damped so rotation is n't too free and easy . Better still , there are dual operating modes available via a ` Custom mode ' switch on the side of the barrel . By default , mode 1 enables manual focusing or manual override of autofocus , whereas mode 2 gives the option of aperture control without click steps . Samyang says that other custom mode options will be made available via future firmware updates . Performance Living up to its billing , autofocus is fast and accurate . Sharpness across most of the image frame is very impressive even when shooting wide-open at f/1 .8 , although it drops off a fair bit at the edges . At their widest apertures fast prime lenses often suffer from noticeable axial -LRB- longitudinal -RRB- chromatic aberration , also referred to as ` bokeh fringing ' . The Samyang does well to minimize this , so colour fringing around the edges of objects in a scene that are in front of or behind the point of focus are quite negligible . Bokeh itself is fairly smooth but not quite as creamy as from most 85mm f/1 .4 lenses . It remains pretty good when stopping down a little , thanks to a well-rounded nine-blade diaphragm . Even when uncorrected , lateral chromatic aberration is barely noticeable . There 's a little pincushion distortion , while vignetting -LRB- darkened image corners -RRB- can be apparent at wide aperture settings . Automatic in-camera corrections are available for all of these aberrations . Lab data Sharpness Sharpness is excellent across most of the frame but drops off a bit at the extreme edges and corners , throughout the aperture range . Fringing There 's very minimal lateral chromatic aberration at wide apertures , although it creeps up a bit in the corners at medium to narrow settings . Distortion : 0.32 Pincushion is fairly slight and will usually go unnoticed in real-world shooting , especially in portraiture and still-life images . Verdict This lens fulfills its promise , enabling you to carry a fast , short telephoto prime without bulking up your kit or being weighed down . It also delivers a particularly well-balanced shooting experience on mirrorless camera bodies . Image quality is highly impressive , autofocus is fast and reliable , and the dual-mode focus/aperture control ring is a handling bonus . Best of all , the lens delivers all this at a very attractive selling price , making it great value for money .

The Buccaneers are in the market for a pass rusher to stand in behind Jason Pierre-Paul and Shaquil Barrett . While there are many veteran options available , Taco Charlton has recently become a free agent and would be a perfect acquisition for Tampa Bay . Charlton has struggled to get his NFL career off the ground . In three seasons , he only has nine sacks and has never lived up to his first-round status in the 2017 NFL Draft . After starting his career in Dallas , Charlton recently played for the Dolphins before he was cut earlier this evening . The Buccaneers may have been looking for veteran depth with a clear track record , but Charlton could be an even better option . As what happens with many first-round draft picks , Taco has cracked under the pressure that inevitably hangs over first-round draft picks . Charlton struggled to see the field during his first season in Dallas , and the `` bust '' title loomed over his head before he even received a real chance . Year two for Charlton saw a decline from an already-poor rookie campaign , and Dallas quickly cut bait after just two seasons . Miami worked out slightly better for Charlton , where he was able to account for 5.0 sacks in five starts , but the Dolphins decided this was not a fit too . Charlton would experience a very different scenario in Tampa Bay . Taco would not be called upon to start at all in his first year , and may even see as many as two years on the bench behind JPP and Barrett before having a shot at starting . This time out of the limelight is exactly what Charlton needs to refine his game and start over . It should also not be forgotten that Todd Bowles would be the perfect coach to help revive the young defensive player 's career . Taco would get the opportunity to learn behind two great pass rushers , but the Buccaneers would benefit from a solid depth piece that would n't cost as much as a veteran . On top of that , if Taco were able to turn his game around , the Buccaneers would then have a replacement for JPP to pair up with Barrett down the road . This is a very low-risk opportunity for Tampa Bay . The price would still be lower than most other options and would also give the team some more young depth on their roster to pair up alongside Anthony Nelson . If there was a team to do it , the Buccaneers are best-suited to help Taco Charlton revive his career , and the move should be made as soon as possible .", "url": "https://thepewterplank.com/2020/04/30/taco-charlton-perfect-fit-tampa-bay-buccaneers/", "kws": ["Tampa^^Bay^^Buccaneers", "Buccaneers", "Taco^^Charlton", "Tampa", "Charlton", "Miami", "Dolphins", "Dallas", "first-round^^draft^^picks", "NFL^^Draft", "veteran^^depth", "Anthony^^Nelson", "Todd^^Bowles", "Jason^^Pierre-Paul", "veteran", "bait", "Shaquil^^Barrett", "JPP", "track^^record", "free^^agent"], "text_category": {"first_cat": {"Sports": 1.0000100135803223}, "second_cat": {"Sports_Football": 1.0000100135803223}, "third_cat": {"Sports_Football_NFL": 1.0}}, "ne_content_person": {"Anthony Nelson": 1, "Shaquil Barrett": 1, "Charlton": 8, "Barrett": 2, "Todd Bowles": 1, "Taco": 1, "Jason Pierre-Paul": 1, "Taco Charlton": 1}, "src": "FanSided", "c_word": 490, "para_count": null, "para_length": null, "image_count": 1, "geotag": [{"name": "tampa", "score": 0.9962355494499207, "coord": "27.950575,-82.457178", "pid": "tampa,florida", "type": "city"}], "title_c_count": 10}

The $ 795 million contract calls for Fincantieri Marinette Marine to move forward with design and construction of the lead ship , with options for up to nine more frigates , the Navy announced Thursday . The contract carries a value of $ 5.6 billion if all 10 ships are built , the Navy said . Construction in the first new major shipbuilding program in more than a decade will begin in Marinette , Wisconsin , by April 2022 , and the first ship will be delivered in 2026 , James Geurts , the Navy 's assistant secretary for research , development and acquisition , told reporters . `` The Navy 's guided-missile frigate will be an important part of our future fleet , '' Chief of Naval Operations , Adm. Mike Gilday , said in a statement . Frigates are multi-mission ships that are smaller and less costly than the Navy 's fleet of Arleigh Burke-class destroyers . Maine 's Bath Iron Works helped to design the last frigates , the Oliver Hazard Perry class , the last ship of which retired from duty in 2015 . The Navy is seeking smaller warships that are more deadly and heavily armored compared to the Navy 's current line of small , speedy warships known as littoral combat ships . The littoral combat ships have been criticized for being lightly armored and lacking firepower . The Navy pressed to expedite the process for the new class of frigates by using existing ship designs . Fincantieri Marinette Marine drew upon the Italian-French design for its proposal . `` When we began this journey nearly two years ago it was with the belief that there was a place for new ideas , new platforms and new partners in an already talented U.S. shipbuilding industry , '' said Fincantieri Marine Group CEO Dario Deste . `` Today 's announcement validates that thinking . '' The announcement was disappointing for the other three finalists : Bath Iron Works , a General Dynamics subsidiary , along with Austal USA in Alabama , and Huntington Ingalls in Mississippi . Marinette likely stood out for the contract because it has less work than the major shipyards , Bath and Ingalls , and is better prepared to undertake the project , said Loren Thompson , defense analyst at the Lexinginton Institute . `` The Navy was confident in its design and knew that Marinette has the available skills to do the work on time , '' he said . The total cost of the first frigate , including design costs and other factors , is expected to be $ 1.28 billion while the average costs of the rest of the ships would be $ 781 million apiece , Geurts said .", "url": "https://www.beloitdailynews.com/news/wisconsin-news/wisconsin-shipyard-wins-contract-to-build-navy-frigates/article_043b5c67-e307-58fa-89f6-b7f5d732ae4d.html", "kws": ["Frigates", "Navy", "Fincantieri^^Marinette^^Marine", "littoral^^combat^^ships", "Naval^^Operations", "the^^last^^ship", "multi-mission^^ships", "Arleigh^^Burke-class^^destroyers", "Construction", "Austal^^USA", "Wisconsin", "Maine", "firepower", "Huntington^^Ingalls", "design^^costs", "PORTLAND", "Alabama", "design", "Mississippi", "Adm.^^Mike^^Gilday"], "text_category": {"first_cat": {"PoliticsGovernment": 1.0000100135803223}, "second_cat": {"PoliticsGovernment_Military": 1.0000100135803223}}, "ne_content_person": {"Ingalls": 1, "Geurts": 1, "James Geurts": 1, "Arleigh Burke-class": 1, "Dario Deste": 1, "Mike Gilday": 1, "Oliver Hazard Perry": 1, "Loren Thompson": 1}, "src": "Beloit Daily News", "c_word": 506, "para_count": 12.0, "para_length": 42.166666666666664, "image_count": 0.0, "geotag": [{"name": "portland", "score": 0.9749374985694885, "coord": "43.661471,-70.255326", "pid": "portland,maine", "type": "city"}, {"name": "Wisconsin", "score": 1.0, "pid": "wisconsin", "type": "state"}], "title_c_count": 8}

Whether it 's from balconies , outdoor spaces or backyards and gardens , more people than usual are looking up in lockdown . You can , of course , go out on any clear night and look at the stars . Look elsewhere on my page and you 'll find guides to some of the constellations you can see this season . However , the one-off celestial highlights -- almost all of them known about in advance -- require some timing . So here 's a skywatcher 's guide to some of the celestial events happening this season , from May through July . You wo n't be able to see all of them from where you live , but from a supermoon and a couple of meteor showers to a couple of lunar eclipses , a `` ring of fire '' solar eclipse and some ultra-bright planets , there 's sure to be something for you to look forward to seeing in the night sky . Stargazing in May 2020 May 5 -- Eta Aquarids meteor shower Predicted to peak in the early hours of Tuesday , May 5 , the Eta Aquarids meteor shower actually began on April 19 and will last until May 31 producing an estimated 60 meteors an hour -LRB- for observers on the equator and in the southern hemisphere -RRB- . Sadly it 's very close to the full moon , which will drown-out all but the brightest of `` shooting stars , '' but some may be visible from across the world . May 7 -- ` Super Flower Moon ' Named for the arrival of spring flowers , the `` Super Flower Moon '' is the fourth and final supermoon of 2020 . Although only ever-so-slightly bigger -LRB- and therefore a touch brighter -RRB- than an average full moon , it will still be a beautiful sight . Stargazing in June 2020 June 4 -- Lookout for Mercury Just after sunset the tiny planet will be at its `` greatest eastern elongation , '' which puts it low in the western horizon for a short time after sunset . June 5 -- ` Strawberry Moon Eclipse ' Occurring two weeks before an annular solar eclipse , this slight penumbral lunar eclipse will see 57 % of the Moon covered by Earth 's outer shadow , so visibly drop in brightness . It will be observable from Asia , Africa and Australia . The rest of the world will see a beautiful full moon -- best caught at moonrise and moonset . June 19 -- Occultation of Venus Just occasionally the Moon slips across a bright planet . That will happen on June 19 when 4 % - lit waning gibbous Moon covers Venus completely as seen from the northeast U.S. region . June 21 -- ` Solstice Ring of Fire Solar Eclipse ' Exactly two weeks after a lunar eclipse comes a solar eclipse on the exact date of the June solstice . From Africa , the Middle East , northern India and southern China , a bright circle of sunlight will be visible around the Moon for around a minute . Intrepid eclipse-chasers will mostly have to miss this one because of COVID-19 travel bans , though there are plenty of eclipse-chasers and astronomers within the `` path of annularity '' that will catch it and stream it online . Check back on my page for links nearer the time . Stargazing in July 2020 July 4 or 5 -- ` Thunder Moon Eclipse ' on July Fourth Happening exactly two weeks after a solar eclipse , this third event of summer 's `` eclipse season '' wo n't be much more of a sight to full moon-gazers than usual . The `` Thunder Moon '' will , for a short time , enter Earth 's outer space-shadow and , as seen from South America , North America and Africa , lose 35 % of its brightness . In the U.S. it happens on July 4 , Independence Day . Another one will happen hours after Thanksgiving 2020 . July 14 -- Jupiter at Opposition On one day each year Earth slides directly between the Sun and each outer planet , making that planet seem to be the brightest it ever gets as seen from Earth . Today it 's the turn of Jupiter ; get yourself a small telescope and you 'll be able to make-out its distinctive cloud bands . Even with binoculars you 'll easily see its four largest moons -- and not just on this specific day . Although `` opposition '' is a great date for amateur astronomers ' diaries , a planet is actually really bright for some weeks either side . July 20 -- Saturn at opposition The same thing will happen with Saturn just a week after Jupiter , so if you 've never seen the giant planet 's incredible rings with your own eyes , now is a good time to borrow a small telescope . Better still , it 's New Moon today , so the skies will be dark , so it 's a good nigh for stargazing . July 28 and 29 -- Delta Aquarids meteor shower About 20 `` shooting stars '' could be visible from the peak of this meteor shower , which runs from July 12 through August 23 .

Babysitters can still do a lot of what they 'd do in person , like helping with homework or school projects , playing games like `` Simon Says , '' ' I Spy '' or `` 20 Questions '' or engaging in creative play like choreographing dances or reading books , Forbes reported . `` The days are so challenging and I feel bad when the day ends because we are exhausted and have had the kids really watching TV or movies or playing on their iPads most of the day , '' said Erin Butler , who recently wrote about the challenges of working from home during quarantine on LinkedIn . `` It 's been tough trying to juggle our schedules and keep the kids occupied ... and alive .

Bell joined director of athletics Greg Byrne and head coach Nick Saban in being optimistic that college football season will take place in Tuscaloosa , Ala. , this fall as scheduled , despite complications caused by the novel coronavirus pandemic . `` As we look to accomplish yet another great fall semester , welcoming back students , welcoming back our sports teams to be able to have competition , '' Bell told CBS 42 . `` ... Certainly , our plan is that we 'll have a season and we 'll have fans as part of that season in our stadium . So , we 're working towards that . We 're at April 30 , and our first games are in September . '' Bell is hopeful students can return to campus for the Aug. 19 start of the fall semester . UA recently stated via Twitter it has been planning for and will continue to work toward in-person instruction this fall on the regular schedule , while the possibility of returning to in-person classes for the Summer 2 term is also being reviewed . That would be good news for football . Due to the COVID-19 pandemic , the SEC suspended all in-person athletics activities through at least May 31 . That includes all practices , meetings and gatherings -- mandatory and voluntary . However , Saban and his staff are allowed eight hours per week to virtually meet with players via Zoom video conferences , where they check in on them and then break down film . But the 14th-year head coach is hopeful that his team can come back to campus in the summer to start preparing for its 2020 season opener against USC on Sept. 5 in Arlington , Texas . `` I think college football is really important to college athletics . I think everybody knows that quite a bit of the revenue that supports all the sports at any university comes from football , '' Saban said last week . `` But you also have to make sure it 's going to be safe to be able to do it . I really ca n't make any predictions . I 'm hopeful that sometime in the summer the players can come back here and we can get around the players and they can get back to school . `` We 're doing as much research as we can , whether it 's talking to Abbott about what kind of testing programs we could implement here for the safety of the players and our students . `` But I do n't think anybody knows what is college football going to look like ? What is any football going to look like ? Are we going to have seats between fans ? Are we going to come up with a solution that allows people to go to games ? Are we going to have to test people to get in stadiums ? Are we going to have to play games with nobody ? Are we even going to be able to play games at all ? I 'm hopeful . And we 've got so many great people in this country that do research and develop and they solve the problems that I feel confident that somebody will come up with some solution that will get us back to normal sometime here soon .

'' And , he added that we know for certain that public pools will not be included in either Phase One or Phase Two of the plan to reopen Kentucky . Because of this week 's announcements , Owensboro Parks and Recreation reaffirms that the following parks will remain closed -LRB- at least for now -RRB- : Jack C. Fisher Park , Edge Ice Center , Dugan Best Recreation Center , Combest and Cravens Pools and all Sprayparks . Summer Camps in Owensboro are also affected by the decision . According to Rogers , originally scheduled Summer Day Camps at the Edge Ice Center or the Parks Admin Center will not operate . She adds. , `` We do not anticipate that will be on our standard summer schedule , or prior to July . '' Of course , we 'll continue to monitor the situation as will the team at Owensboro Parks and Recreation .

Because why should n't the toilet double as an office chair ? But while buying a tiny home on Amazon is easy , finding a place to put it is not : Most cities are still figuring out how these micro-dwellings fit into existing building and zoning ordinances . Where it gets complicated Tiny homes on wheels are often classified as RVs and subject to parking rules . Tiny houses built on foundations are typically labeled `` accessory dwelling units , '' or secondary residences located on the property of an existing house . Developers can also seek permission to build `` pocket neighborhoods '' consisting of standalone tiny homes clustered around a shared open space . While some states are generally friendlier to tiny homes than others , it 's probably up to your local Leslie Knope to determine if , where , and how you can build one . But relatively few cities have specific provisions . It was n't until 2018 that the IRC , the bible for local building codes , added tiny home-specific guidelines . Getting cities to ease regulations or rewrite the books usually requires grassroots movement . In Jacksonville , FL , Habitat for Humanity had to get the city council to rezone a plot in order to build a community of 50 tiny homes . Could COVID-19 tip the scales ? Several cities are showing renewed interest in tiny homes as a housing solution for at-risk populations during the pandemic . Tiny homes can cost < $ 15,000 to build , and while there 's no room for a floating kitchen island , they do offer the necessities for daily living . Seattle recently accelerated a tiny home development . Lane County , OR , repurposed transitional tiny housing for homeless COVID-19 patients . A Honolulu city council member is even looking to tap federal funds for pandemic relief to help erect 6,000 units for healthcare workers and homeless individuals . Case study : San Jose Like many California cities , San Jose is facing a housing crisis -- homelessness has spiked 42 % in the last two years . COVID-19 is straining limited shelter resources even further . Three years ago , the city tried developing a parcel of land into a tiny home community for homeless individuals , but those plans were scrapped after nearby residents protested . Now , the city council is pushing a $ 17 million plan for 500 tiny homes for its homeless population , including on that original plot . A public health emergency means the city can sidestep public input , housing commission meetings , and environmental studies to quickly spin up housing . But some residents claim San Jose is using the pandemic to push through an unpopular housing project . Opponents are concerned tiny homes will depreciate existing property values , lead to an increase in crime , and disrupt neighborhood aesthetics . Bottom line : More local governments are easing tiny home regulations to bring in new residents and support housing insecure constituents .

One where they naturally observe and complete necessary tasks around the house without throwing privileged man-child tantrums that could put a 2-year-old to shame . Sounds too good to be true , does n't it ? But why ? Because even in the 21st century , patriarchy and gender stereotypes are very much still a thing . And if someone disagrees , just show them this so-called chores chart listing out basic tasks for `` Daddy '' and the rewards awaiting the overgrown baby upon completing them : This chores chart -- which we imagine was crafted by a desperate , fed-up , overworked , and run-down mother and wife/girlfriend -- promises a range of rewards for the man of the house in return for completing tasks such as washing dishes , putting the damn toilet seat down , changing diapers , and packing the kids ' lunch . You know , all the tasks that make men lose their manliness . Oh , the horror ! Given the complexity of the tasks demanded of this poor man , the reward for completing the chores are adequately enticing . From a naked hula dance to a 12-pack of beer , this chores chart is n't playing around when it comes to rewards . This image -- that 's got my blood boiling with disgust -- was posted to Reddit by user Wolf_Mommy who stated in a comment : Chore chart for a husband . I get that the spirit of this is humor , but it just makes me feel a little sick . It just does n't feel right to offer up sexual intimacy for housework or child care . Could you imagine if this were a chore chart for a wife ? It also perpetuates the myth of the Incompetent Dad . Men do n't need a reward chore chart like this to participate in the routine of activities of daily living , do they ? Although this Reddit user is willing to give it the benefit of the doubt and has generously attempted to see some humor in it , nothing -- and I repeat -- absolutely nothing about this is funny . Aside from perpetuating stereotypical ideas of fatherhood , it propagates negative stereotypes of wives and reeks of internalized misogyny . For example , the reward for putting the toilet seat down , daddy gets a whole week of no nagging . Because , of course , women = nagging . Even worrying is the fact that this scenario seems to include children who will undoubtedly go on to pick up these oppressive gender roles and expectations from their parents . Joke or no joke , some men seem to be in full favor of this chart . Redditor Stevo6456 commented : Okay , maybe it 's just because I am male and lazy , but this seems like a really good idea . I am guilty of not doing the chores , I am also guilty of loving BJs , so I think if there is a way to get one by doing extra around the house , then I think it 's a great idea , and clearly , the wife does n't mind . After all , most of what we do is controlled by rewards , so hey , I wo n't judge this , it is perfectly fine with me . On the other hand , Reddit user Jesster114 stood up for gender equality , writing : I do n't think I 'd be able to drink fast enough to keep up with the dishes reward . I constantly do the dishes , but just so the kitchen is clean . It helps keep my girlfriend and I happy . She does n't like doing dishes and I find it kind of meditative . She picks up junk around the house which I am kind of oblivious to . We buy and do fun things together because they are fun to do , not because of some reward system .

Judge Marcia G. Cooke , in an order late Thursday , also told U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement to retrain staffers about the risks of COVID-19 , and figure out ways to cut the populations in each of the facilities down to 75 % of capacity to enhance social distancing . And she gave ICE a list of 34 specific detainees to strongly consider for release . `` The court recognizes that complying with this order poses several procedural and logistical hurdles for ICE , however , at the time of this writing there are at least 30,000 confirmed COVID-19 cases and over 1,000 related deaths in Florida alone , '' wrote the judge , a George W. Bush appointee . `` Time is of the essence . Accordingly , the court fully expects ICE to work with a sense of urgency to meet the deadlines set forth and refrain from requests for extensions of time absent extenuating circumstances . '' But she declined a mass release , saying her role as a judge in this case is to stop dangerous conditions , not to automatically free those who complain about them . The Southern Poverty Law Center said the judge 's decision was a move in the right direction . `` The cruel irony is ICE never had reason to detain those under its custody in the first place . There is no justification to force immigrants to navigate their civil immigration matters from behind bars , '' said Paul R. Chavez , senior supervising attorney with the SPLC 's Immigrant Justice Project . Federal courts across the country are grappling with similar decisions , as health experts say prisons , jails and detention centers , with their close quarters , are prime grounds for the spread of the virus . Indeed , maps showing unusual hotspots of coronavirus cases in rural areas often point to a prison or jail where dozens of cases have spread . When it comes to ICE facilities , judges have split in their decisions . In Massachusetts , a federal judge is working through the entire list of detainees at two facilities , deciding whom to free . In Seattle , a federal judge rejected a similar broad request for releases . But in cases across the country , individual migrants are suing and winning release orders . ICE argues it 's following the guidelines from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention as best as possible . It 's also making some releases on its own . Judge Cooke said the agency has n't met the CDC 's standards . `` ICE has failed to provide detainees in some detention centers with masks , soap and other cleaning supplies , and failed to ensure that all detainees housed at the three detention centers can practice social distancing , '' she wrote . She said because ICE has made releases from some centers -- including one where it released all detainees 60 years of age or older -- it has shown it 's aware of the dangers . So to the extent it has n't made similar moves elsewhere , it proves `` deliberate indifference . '' `` These failures have placed petitioners at a heightened risk of not only contracting COVID-19 , but also succumbing to the fatal effects of the virus as some of the petitioners have serious underlying medical illness , '' the judge wrote . `` Such failures amount to cruel and unusual punishment because they are exemplary of deliberate indifference .

As it does so , ICAO must maintain CORSIA 's environmental integrity . To that end , airlines should not be allowed to count , for CORSIA compliance , carbon credits that have been found to be invalid , e.g. , fraudulently issued or otherwise not meeting CORSIA 's standards for credit quality . To ensure that all credits represent actual emission reductions , such substandard credits should be invalidated -- even if the fraud is n't exposed until after airlines have canceled the credits in CORSIA . The emissions for which the credits had been tendered have occurred , and still need to be covered by valid reductions in order to meet CORSIA 's promise of `` carbon neutral growth . '' California offers one approach to how CORSIA can do this . In its market-based climate program , California has developed a way to cover the emissions from invalidated credits to uphold the integrity of its program and encourage emitters to invest only in high-integrity offsets . It 's known as `` buyer liability , '' which means that if the California Air Resources Board -LRB- CARB -RRB- , the regulatory body , invalidates offset credits , then those who purchased the credits for compliance with California 's emissions limit must replace the invalidated credits . This ensures that emitters meet their full compliance obligations and that they are more diligent in selecting offsets . Early on , California 's buyer liability approach caused some uncertainty among offset project developers . But seven years of experience demonstrates that buyer liability has worked in California 's carbon market . Here 's how we know : 1 . California 's `` buyer liability '' approach has only invalidated a small number of credits . Since the inception of California 's carbon market in 2013 , CARB has issued almost 173 million offset credits . Of these , 35 million were issued under the portion of the program that uses the `` buyer liability '' approach . Only 107,822 -- 0.3 % -- of these have been invalidated . Invalidation is rare , likely due to stringent offset protocols and buyers exercising due diligence in purchasing credits . 2 . Offset usage has increased over the life of the program . California allows covered entities to offset emission reductions by purchasing a limited amount offset credits . Buyer liability does not appear to have hampered the ability of covered entities to find and use high quality offset credits . In fact , the use of offset credits for compliance has increased since the carbon market began in California . During the first compliance period -LRB- 2013-2014 -RRB- , regulated entities used offsets to cover approximately 4.5 % of their total obligation . The usage limit is 8 % , so companies were using just over half of the amount of allowed offset credits . During the second compliance period -LRB- 2015-2017 -RRB- , entities used offsets to meet 6.4 % of their compliance obligation , and market analysists predicted pre-COVID-19 that companies would use offsets to meet 7 % of their obligation during the current compliance period . Global health crisis notwithstanding , demand for offsets appears to have steadily increased over time . 3 . The California government undertook three investigations of offset credits ; prices remained stable through all three investigations . CARB undertook three investigations into already-issued offset credits . CARB investigated these in response to allegations that the projects had violated environmental rules , dumping pollution into the air and onto land even as they cut carbon emissions . In two of these investigations , CARB invalidated the credits . Even so , overall offset prices remained stable .

Note that the 2016 price dip coincides with an overall drop in California carbon prices due to legal proceedings and legislative action , both unrelated to offset credits . Price data form CaliforniaCarbon.Info -LRB- $ -RRB- . 4 . Buyer Liability is a key tool for CORSIA integrity , but needs clear rules to encourage due diligence by buyers . California 's experience shows that carefully designed buyer liability rules can help maintain the integrity of carbon markets . While buyer liability introduces some uncertainty for market actors , California 's decision to adopt , in advance , clear rules and standards for invalidation reduced the effect of this uncertainty . Although California could clarify its rules with respect to the impact of an ongoing investigation on the length of an invalidation period , the rules are specific for what could trigger an investigation and subsequent invalidation of offset credits , so market actors -- emitters , project developers , and verifiers -- understand the parameters -LRB- see § 95985 -LRB- c -RRB- of the cap-and-trade regulations -RRB- . Preserving CORSIA 's environmental integrity This case study of California illustrates that while a `` buyer liability '' approach to offset credits contains some inherent risk , it does not appear to have had a negative long-term impact on California 's market , and indeed has helped the program preserve its model standards of environmental integrity . CORSIA should develop detailed standards for when offset credits can be investigated and potentially retroactively invalidated , set forth a clear timeline for those investigations and invalidations , and ensure full transparency of the process . The goal of such an approach is to preserve the environmental integrity of CORSIA , so all of the reported emission reductions from international aviation result in real benefits to the global climate .", "url": "http://blogs.edf.org/climate411/2020/05/01/californias-experience-with-buyer-liability-shows-how-aviation-can-help-ensure-environmental-integrity/", "kws": ["environmental^^integrity", "CORSIA^^compliance", "environmental^^rules", "buyer^^liability", "international^^aviation^^result", "CORSIA^^integrity", "detailed^^standards", "stringent^^offset^^protocols", "Civil^^Aviation", "emissions^^reduction", "credit^^quality", "actual^^emission^^reductions", "valid^^reductions", "Environment", "Reduction^^Scheme", "carbon^^emissions", "California^^carbon^^prices", "air^^quality", "real^^benefits", "covered^^entities"], "text_category": {"first_cat": {"Society": 0.9433759450912476}, "second_cat": {"Society_Advocacy": 0.9433759450912476}, "third_cat": {"Society_Advocacy_EnvironmentalIssues": 0.9433759450912476}}, "ne_content_person": {}, "src": "edf.org", "c_word": 1037, "para_count": 21.0, "para_length": 49.38095238095238, "image_count": 2, "geotag": [{"name": "California", "score": 1.0, "pid": "california", "type": "state"}], "title_c_count": 14}

The three companies , which include firms of tech billionaires Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos , will share $ 967 million from NASA , though specific amounts each company will receive were not immediately known . Boeing Co proposed a lander concept last year but was not selected . `` This is the last piece that we need in order to get to the moon , '' NASA administrator Jim Bridenstine told reporters on Thursday , calling the agency 's first lunar lander procurement since 1972 `` historic . '' Unlike the Apollo program that put astronauts on the moon nearly 50 years ago , NASA is gearing up for a long-term presence on Earth 's satellite that the agency says will eventually enable humans to reach Mars , leaning heavily on private companies built around shared visions for space exploration . Picking three providers allows NASA to have redundancy in case one company falls behind in development , Lisa Watson-Morgan , NASA 's human landing system program manager , told reporters on Thursday . `` I think we 've got the potential for an incredibly exciting future in space with a base on the moon , and ultimately sending people and having a self-sustaining city on Mars , '' Musk , who also leads electric car firm Tesla , said Thursday . Last year , Bezos unveiled Blue Origin 's design for the lunar lander , Blue Moon , it intends to build as a prime contractor with Lockheed Martin , Northrop Grumman and Draper . Blue Origin plans to launch its landing system using its own heavy-lift rocket , New Glenn . Musk 's SpaceX , which is on the cusp of launching its first manned mission for NASA next month , will develop its Starship landing system to send crew and up to 100 pounds of cargo to the moon . Dynetics , a unit of Leidos Holdings Inc , develops human landing system , which the Boeing-Lockheed joint venture , United Launch Alliance , will launch on its Vulcan system . BOEING NOT PICKED Cutting Boeing out of a key NASA spaceflight effort deals a blow to the aerospace giant 's space wing , which for decades has been a key International Space Station contractor and more recently a secondary provider in NASA 's efforts to launch humans to the station under its Commercial Crew Program . NASA said it removed Boeing and another company as bidders for the lunar lander award early on in the selection process , though a specific reason was not immediately clear . Last month , Boeing lost to competitor SpaceX in a separate competition for cargo delivery services to a lunar space station , with NASA saying in a memo `` Boeing 's proposal was the highest priced and the lowest rated under the Mission Suitability factor . '' NASA in recent months has been quicker to call out Boeing for its fumbles on various agency programs , such as delays in its heavy-lift rocket Space Launch System that remains years behind schedule , billions over budget and has suffered dozens of engineering setbacks . The Space Launch System , which has not yet flown , is currently NASA 's ride for transporting humans off Earth and to the moon by 2024 , but the rocket 's debut mission has already slipped back a year into 2021 .

Div . and Fort Carson , to honor Days of Remembrance and Holocaust Remembrance Day . Between 1933 and 1945 , the Nazi regime and its collaborators carried out the genocide of six million Jews and millions of other people deemed as racially or socially unfit . This tragic time in human history continued until German Armed Forces surrendered to Allied Forces on May 7 , 1945 . This genocide came to be known as the Holocaust . In 1980 , the U.S. Congress established the Days of Remembrance as our nation 's annual commemoration of the Holocaust . The Holocaust Remembrance Day , adopted by the United Nations General Assembly on November 1 , 2005 , recognizes the Auschwitz-Birkenau concentration camp liberation on January 27 , 1945 . This year , the Holocaust Days of Remembrance week will be observed April 19-26 , 2020 . During this time , we honor the millions who tragically lost their lives and the countless victims and survivors who endured great suffering . This April , as we reflect on the horrific events that defined the Holocaust , let us also recognize and remember the men and women of the Allied Forces who fought to end tyranny and oppression . We encourage all members of the 4th Infantry Division and Fort Carson team to participate in virtual and online educational opportunities sponsored by the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum . This virtual experience is available at : https://www.ushmm.org/information/exhibitions/online-exhibitions . Respect and honor is a central part of high performing organizations , and absolutely critical to maintaining trust and cohesion .

And unless you live in a mansion , taking a photo of your car parked outside your front door does n't show it off to its best . So here 's a brilliant home project you can shoot right on your driveway , and create a high-quality studio look that 's right out of a car catalogue -- but without needing to go to a studio or use stacks of complicated studio gear ! Enter two of an enthusiastic photographer 's most transformative tools : Photoshop and flash lighting . By lighting the car with flash , we 're able to overpower the natural light so that it plays a minimal role in the exposure , which gives us the dark moody look we want . Ideally this would be achieved by using a huge bank of flash units in unison , but for most of us that 's just not a realistic option . So this is where the Photoshop part comes in . By using a tripod to keep the camera still , we have the freedom to take multiple frames and then blend them together afterwards in Photoshop . As such , we do n't necessarily need an arsenal of lights all at once to get the studio look ; we can simply use one or two , then light the car one section at a time over a series of shots . It also means that we can create a subtle reflection with a single piece of reflective board , again by moving it into different positions over a series of shots . Let 's take a look at how it 's done ... Lighting the car 01 Set an exposure After setting the camera up on a tripod , composing and focusing on the car , we work out a manual exposure that underexposes the natural light , so it barely registers . On an overcast day here we had 1/200 sec and f/11 , ISO100 , giving a near-dark image . Shooting at around 35mm will enable you to fit the car into frame without too much distortion ; a 16-35mm zoom will be able to accommodate you with however much space you have to work with . 02 Fire the flash Next we set up a single studio flash , powered through the mains . The flash is set to optical slave , triggered wirelessly and set to full power -LRB- 400w -RRB- . By popping the flash at different angles we can pick out various parts of the car and emphasize the flowing lines . • Best photography lighting kits 03 Move the flash Try lighting the car from all angles with the flash . Experiment with backlighting from behind the car in order to highlight the edges and the curves . Direct the flash at specific areas like the wheels and grill . Take lots of shots and hold the light up high or down low . 04 Capture the reflection Once we 've lit the car , we start the reflection . We place two studio lights on either side to light the sides and lower section of the car , then take several frames , moving the reflective board around between shots to capture a complete reflection . Build the image in Photoshop 01 Load into layers After picking the frames we want , we open them up as a layered document in Photoshop . This can be done by selecting the files in Bridge , then going to Tools > Photoshop > Load into Layers , or in Photoshop by using File > Scripts > Load Files into Stack . 02 Add a mask Choose a shot to use as a base and drag it to the bottom of the stack , then hide all but the layer above . Toggle this layer on and off to determine the lit area of the car that you want to blend , then hold Alt and click the Add Layer Mask icon to hide the layer behind a full black mask . 03 Reveal the lighting Grab the Brush tool , right-click and set hardness to 0 . Hit D to set the color to white then paint over the car to reveal the area of the image you want . Once done , reveal the next layer up , then add a full mask again and paint more white . Continue building up the light . 04 Build the reflection Next we can piece together the reflection , by masking and revealing the pieces of the board until they form a complete reflection along the car . The layers will start to mount up , so it may be easier to build the reflection separately then copy it over once complete . 05 Liquify to fix The gravel driveway here is uneven , so the reflection does n't match up in places .

Today , the company announced how it plans to use it . Starting late next year , Bollinger will offer a chassis cab version of the platform to commercial customers . Called the Bollinger B2 Chassis Cab , or B2CC , it 'll be `` the world 's first and only Class 3 all-electric chassis-cab truck platform , '' according to the company . Bollinger will offer the B2CC in both two - and four-door configurations in both full-cab and cutaway-cab variants with various wheelbase lengths , providing customers with numerous possibilities . Commercial companies flock to chassis cab trucks so they can install their own aftermarket or third-party accessories for whatever job they need to do . It 's no different for the B2CC , either . The B2CC is based on the B2 electric pickup truck -- both of which ride on the same E-Chassis platform . It 'll feature a 120-kilowatt-hour battery pack and a twin-electric-motor setup that provides all-wheel-drive capabilities . Payload capacity tops out at 5,000 pounds -LRB- 2,267 kilograms -RRB- . Other features include portal gear hubs , a `` patent-pending passthrough , '' and a self-leveling suspension . Commercial customers will enjoy complete power system controls -- which are configurable for each vehicle application -- a 10-kW onboard charger/inverter , and an integrated thermal management system . Gallery : Bollinger Motors B2 Chassis Cab Bollinger says the B2CC could be used by a variety of services , such as first responders , construction companies , municipalities , park services , and more . Images Bollinger provided of the B2CC shows some of the possibilities -- like a bucket truck or tow truck . The B2CC is yet another Bollinger we 'll be waiting to see hit the open road . The company says it 'll be in late 2021 . Pricing has n't been announced , though it 's likely dependent on the B2CC 's desired configuration . Next year will also see Bollinger put the B1 and B2 into production , which both have a $ 125,000 price tag .", "url": "https://www.motor1.com/news/419328/bollinger-electric-chassis-cab-truck/", "kws": ["Chassis", "cab^^trucks", "Bollinger^^Motors", "four-door^^configurations", "Images^^Bollinger", "all-wheel-drive^^capabilities", "trucks", "accessories", "ride", "Pricing", "portal^^gear^^hubs", "Payload^^capacity", "production", "commercial^^customers", "company", "Commercial^^companies", "construction^^companies", "park^^services", "Gallery", "numerous^^possibilities"], "text_category": {"first_cat": {"TransportationVehicles": 0.9999884366989136}, "second_cat": {"TransportationVehicles_Vehicles": 0.9999884366989136}}, "ne_content_person": {"Bollinger": 8}, "src": "motor1.com", "c_word": 362, "para_count": 7.0, "para_length": 51.714285714285715, "image_count": 1, "geotag": [], "title_c_count": 9}

Andrew Cuomo was snubbing Broadway by shutting the industry out of his New York Forward Re-Opening Advisory Board , the state and the theater industry are working closely on how to re-start , Charlotte St. Martin , president of the Broadway League , tells Deadline . `` We are completely aligned with his thinking , '' St. Martin said of Cuomo , noting that the League is `` deeply grateful '' for the governor 's leadership `` on this critical matter . '' According to St. Martin , the League is in ongoing touch with the two advisers heading Cuomo 's pandemic efforts , Steve Cohen and Bill Mulrow . Former aides of the governor most recently working in the private sector -- Cohen is an executive at MacAndrews & Forbes Inc. , Mulrow at The Blackstone Group -- the two were tapped last month to chair the New York Forward advisory board . The advisory board is made up of more than 100 business , community and civic leaders throughout the state , and is tasked with helping guide the state 's re-opening process `` as we work towards a new normal , '' in the governor 's words . Said St. Martin , `` We are in touch with Steve Cohen and Bill Mulrow who have made it clear that NY Forward will be working closely with the Broadway community . '' Cuomo reportedly has sought the advice of theater producer Scott Rudin and theater owner James L. Nederlander with regard to Broadway 's eventual re-opening , though neither of those two industry veterans were listed as part of the New York Forward advisory board last month . The board includes reps from such far-flung industries , organizations and businesses as Spotify , YWCAs of Elmira , MetLife , New York Yankees , Con Edison , Fordham University , the Buffalo Urban League , United Way of Greater Rochester , Goldman Sachs , Ford Foundation , Tribeca Enterprises and Harlem 's Sylvia 's Restaurant . The Broadway League president tells Deadline that Cuomo has instead encouraged the theater industry to develop its own protocols necessary to re-open the Broadway and Off Broadway venues that have been dark since March 16 . Last week , Actors ' Equity Association executive director Mary McColl told Deadline that the union , for its part , was doing just that : Equity hired safety consultant David Michaels , former administrator of OSHA under President Barack Obama , to advise on the development of protocols necessary for reopening . Both the League -- the organization representing theater owners and producers -- and the city 's theatrical unions , including Equity , are thought to be giving special and immediate focus at the moment on the financial toll being taken on the industry 's theater workers . The extension of unemployment insurance for actors , for example , and various tax relief plans are among the top priorities . The absence of recognizable Broadway players on the board led to some speculation of hard feelings between Cuomo and the theater industry following Cuomo 's very public dismissal last month of what he seemingly mistakenly thought were Broadway 's plans to re-open on June 7 . Asked by a reporter about the June target at a press briefing last month , Cuomo said , `` I would n't use what Broadway thinks as a barometer of anything unless they 're in the public health business and have seen better numbers and models . '' St. Martin later told Deadline that the reporter 's question was misinformed , and that the June 7 date was never intended for re-opening but rather had been announced as the point up to which the industry was then exchanging and refunding tickets . Most estimates put Broadway 's re-opening at September , earliest .", "url": "https://nypost.com/2020/05/01/broadway-theater-producers-working-with-cuomo-on-re-opening-process/", "kws": ["Broadway", "theater", "Broadway^^League", "Andrew^^Cuomo", "Tribeca^^Enterprises", "producers", "Scott^^Rudin", "New^^York", "recognizable^^Broadway^^players", "Harlem", "producer", "governor", "community", "Blackstone^^Group", "Steve^^Cohen", "Advisory^^Board", "St.^^Martin", "Charlotte^^St.^^Martin", "Ford^^Foundation", "David^^Michaels"], "text_category": {"first_cat": {"ArtsEntertainment": 1.0000085830688477}, "second_cat": {"ArtsEntertainment_Performing": 1.0000085830688477}, "third_cat": {"ArtsEntertainment_Performing_Other": 1.0000085830688477}}, "ne_content_person": {"Cohen": 1, "Mary McColl": 1, "Said St. Martin": 1, "David Michaels": 1, "James L.

We 're no strangers to the fact that Reddit is a repository of all things weird and wonderful . We 've seen our fair share of the wonderful of late , so today 's find is all about the weird -LRB- or the wonderfully weird side of the Interwebs , as we think some of you may find it -RRB- . Whether you 're in the stock photography business or are starting to grow an interest in it , we bring you the strangest collection of snaps that have ever been submitted -- or sneaked -- into some of the leading stock photography websites out there . By its name alone -- WTF Stock Photos -- the subreddit mentioned gives us a clue into what 's in store for those who make the fortunate mistake of browsing around . Stock photography is all about catering to a need for marketing or editorial visuals to either help communicate or illustrate a message better . But the images you 're about to see ... well , we do n't understand what 's happening in these , but it 's hilarious . We 've taken the liberty of sharing 25 of the most entertaining , bizarre , and ridiculous posts from the subreddit 's top posts of all time . The photos are crazy and hilarious , guaranteed to incite thoughts ranging from straight up `` WTF , '' and , `` What was going on in their brains ?! '' to , `` I wonder if there will ever be some use to these ? '' The captions by the Redditors are just as good , so we decided to include them here as well ! It 's especially perplexing how all these made it in well-known stock photo platforms like Getty Images , Shutterstock , and Alamy . Because of that , it may be easier to dismiss them as fakes or troll posts . We did a bit of sleuthing to satisfy our curiosity -LRB- and most likely yours as well -RRB- , and we were very surprised to find that some of the ones we picked are still there . Woman giving birth to an adult man ? Check . Robbery in bakery ? Check . Evil male punk holding a goldfish in a bag with holes poked in it and the water leaking isolated on white background ? Check . Yellow rubber glove and lemon with tongue ? Check . A centaur has met the wrong half -- he was very puzzled . Yes , we were , too , upon meeting the photo . It 's safe to say a good number of these priceless photos are real , and are still around -- whether for our entertainment or someone 's strange visual requirements . So , what do we get out of these ? First , the human mind is a wonderful repository of ideas : whether those work or not is another thing altogether . Also , it takes some mad Photoshop skills to bring even some of the most inconceivable ideas to life . Lastly , if you 're in serious need of any of these stock photos or can make something worthwhile out of these , we 'd like to be your friend . Ca n't get enough ? Why not also check out Humans of Stock Photography as well ? All hilarity aside , it 's definitely challenging to come up with something original , eye-catching , and relevant to the demands and requirements of the stock photography market today . That 's where the creative trends , predictions , and shot lists provided by stock photography platforms for the year come in handy . If you 're new to the craft , these are great places to start .", "url": "https://www.thephoblographer.com/2020/05/01/hilarious-weird-stock-photos/", "kws": ["WTF^^Stock^^Photos", "Stock^^Photos", "stock^^photography^^platforms", "Reddit", "troll^^posts", "thoughts", "well-known^^stock^^photo", "Getty^^Images", "Evil^^male^^punk", "collection", "fair^^share", "fakes", "today", "lists", "Shutterstock", "message", "sleuthing", "store", "predictions", "white^^background"], "text_category": {"first_cat": {"ArtsEntertainment": 0.9992943406105042}, "second_cat": {"ArtsEntertainment_Other": 0.9992943406105042}}, "ne_content_person": {"Alamy": 1}, "src": "thephoblographer.com", "c_word": 660, "para_count": 8.0, "para_length": 82.5, "image_count": 2, "geotag": [], "title_c_count": 17}

Our cameras were rolling as a special lunchtime delivery came with quite a surprise . As it turns out , the man who delivered meals to the medical staff at a Tomball hospital is actually a COVID-19 survivor . He went back to thank the doctors and nurses who saved his life . `` That 's from Feeding the Frontline Ministry . We have homemade pot pie , mashed potatoes , '' the delivery guy explained while showing off the gourmet meal . It was a special delivery indeed . `` This is nothing I could have even dreamed up . This was clearly His plan , a plan from someone bigger than humans , '' smiles the Co-Founder of Feeding the Frontline Cassandra Mays while watching in amazement . THE LATEST : Coronavirus COVID-19 cases , deaths , recoveries in greater Houston area Why is this delivery so astonishing ? Well , Dean Bass is the CEO of Spirit Of Texas Bank . Since the start of the pandemic Bass himself and his bank have donated to the non-profit Feeding the Frontline to pay for meals for medical staff specifically at HCA Houston Healthcare Tomball . He had no idea he was feeding the very doctors and nurses who would save his life after he was rushed to this hospital at 3:00 a.m. sick with severe back pain , a rash and fever from COVID-19 . `` I got out of the ambulance right here , right where I 'm standing now , '' explains Bass . He was admitted to the hospital and days , then nights went by as Bass suffered from this sickness that has taken so many lives . All the while , the hospital staff who Bass calls his angels of light kept coming to his room , encouraging him with every visit . `` It 's dark in that room . It 's dark for a lot of reasons . That door opens and there 's a light . That 's why I call them my angels of light . They brightened my day with every visit '' . Bass showed us a picture of when he was wheeled out of the hospital and finally released to his waiting wife . `` I got out right there and they wanted to wheel me to the car but I jumped and I took off running to the car , '' Bass laughs . Now he 's back , COVID-19 negative , again making a positive difference for doctors and nurses . Bass arrived as Eden 's restaurant delivered the food so he can thank his heroes , healthcare workers who wear scrubs but Bass says they should wear capes . So he bought superhero costumes as keepsakes for the staff that saved his life . `` I want to give them the costumes so they 're reminded they are the superheroes and they are appreciated '' . `` Bless you guys and may God continue to bless you through all of this , '' the restaurant delivery guy smiled to the medical staff as he gave them the gourmet lunch . Bass says he hopes everyone will continue to wear masks , practice social distancing and do everything possible to stop the spread of this virus . Bass ' wife also tested positive for COVID-19 but she never displayed any symptoms .", "url": "https://www.fox26houston.com/news/man-delivers-meals-to-tomball-healthcare-workers-who-treated-his-covid-19-infection", "kws": ["TOMBALL", "meals", "healthcare^^workers", "medical", "doctors", "medical^^staff", "nurses", "severe^^back^^pain", "homemade^^pot^^pie", "mashed^^potatoes", "scrubs", "Coronavirus^^COVID-19^^cases", "deaths", "Frontline", "people", "masks", "Houston", "Frontline^^Ministry", "nights", "Cassandra^^Mays"], "text_category": {}, "ne_content_person": {"Bass": 7, "Eden": 1, "Cassandra Mays": 1, "Dean Bass": 1, "God": 1}, "src": "fox26houston.com", "c_word": 593, "para_count": 12.0, "para_length": 49.416666666666664, "image_count": 1, "geotag": [{"name": "tomball", "score": 0.9950448274612427, "coord": "30.097162,-95.616055", "pid": "tomball,texas", "type": "city"}, {"name": "houston", "score": 0.9753539562225342, "coord": "29.760427,-95.369803", "pid": "houston,texas", "type": "city"}], "title_c_count": 12}

I 'm Diya Chacko , and it 's Friday , May 1 . Here 's what 's happening with the coronavirus outbreak in California and beyond , plus ways to spend your weekend . Gov. Gavin Newsom said Friday that he will make an announcement as early as next week about his plans to begin to ease restrictions on Californians , `` as long as we continue to be prudent and thoughtful . '' The pressure on the governor to reopen California is intensifying following his decision to force the closure of Orange County beaches and rumors that he would do the same statewide . Beaches have become a flashpoint in a way that other parts of life -- such as shopping , working and cheering the Dodgers and Lakers -- have not , as many in the state see a day at the beach as a birthright . Orange County officials decried the closures as government overreach and argued that they had made progress in flattening the coronavirus curve , especially compared with neighboring L.A. County . Some even argued that a trip to the beach might do more good than harm . `` Medical professionals tell us the importance of fresh air and sunlight in fighting infectious diseases , including mental health benefits , '' said Orange County Supervisor Don Wagner , though scientists pushed back on some of those claims . The Huntington Beach City Council voted Thursday night during an emergency session to seek an injunction against Newsom 's order , and other Orange County cities were also weighing their legal options before a Superior Court judge denied the injunction request . More than 500 protesters converged on Huntington Beach on Friday to express their displeasure ; though some wore face coverings , most of them neither wore masks nor followed social distancing guidelines by staying six feet from one another . The sentiment behind the protests is certainly understandable , but scientists say there 's no question the lockdown is working and should n't end prematurely . Though there are significant health risks associated with the stay-at-home orders and the economic devastation it has caused , they can not compare with the massive loss of life that would occur if officials decide to throw up their hands and fast-track herd immunity . `` As a country , we are certainly talking about at least a million deaths if we just reopen and do nothing else , '' one biostatistician said . `` You can try to do a cost-benefit analysis , but it 's hard to put a dollar value on death . '' Whatever their frustrations , Californians have considerable confidence in their state government and say they want to move slowly on ending stay-at-home orders , according to a UC Berkeley poll . The statewide poll also found that 70 % of respondents approve of how Newsom is doing his job , including a growing number of those who identified as Republicans and moderates . In contrast , confidence in the Trump administration has fallen over its response to the pandemic . The Times is tracking closures of the more than 1,500 beaches across the state 's 15 coastal counties . You can search for specific beach restrictions in your area .

Across California A growing number of California tenants are turning their economic hardship into a mass protest , demanding that legislators at all levels of government pass laws to cancel rent until the public health crisis is over . The rent strike is just one tactic marking a dramatic new escalation in the long-running fight over affordable housing in a state where more than 9 million tenants -- more than half of those in the state -- were already burdened by high rents . The growing calls for the rent strike come as a wave of labor unrest sweeps the state , with unions harnessing the momentum to organize protests , rally media coverage and pressure public officials such as Newsom . In Los Angeles , Glendale and Long Beach , thousands of laid-off janitors and hotel workers besieged elected officials with petitions seeking future job guarantees . From Oakland to Monterey Park , employees at dozens of fast-food outlets , including McDonald 's , Domino 's and Wendy 's , walked off their jobs to protest a lack of social distancing measures . Nurses took to the streets in San Francisco , Santa Monica , Irvine and Oceanside to shame hospitals for failing to protect them against the coronavirus . A 32-year-old nurse at an upscale dementia care center on Los Angeles ' Westside died of COVID-19 complications after telling relatives that her employer had instructed her to admit a new resident showing signs of illness , even though the facility was under lockdown . In light of the health risks of being out in public , the California Air Resources Board has halted field inspections to help enforce clean-air rules since mid-March . The hiatus means that an array of pollution sources , from soot-belching diesel trucks and cargo ships to methane-leaking landfills and oil and gas sites , now face far less scrutiny than is typical . California 's indigenous Mexicans and Guatemalans are missing vital pandemic information because of language barriers . Los Angeles is home to Mexicans who speak languages such as Zapotec , Mixtec and Triqui , as well as Guatemalan Maya who speak languages like K'iche ' and Q'anjob ' al. . Many have only a basic grasp of Spanish . `` There 's this concern , are these people really understanding , is there a lack of accurate information in their language ? '' said the director of an indigenous community advocacy group . Resources -- For general safety , wash your hands for at least 20 seconds -LRB- here 's a super-fun how-to video -RRB- .

Here 's guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention . Around the nation and the world As calls grow for scaled-up contact tracing to help chart the path of the virus ' spread , many have pinned their hopes on programs powered by Google and Apple . The rival companies are working with public health authorities and university researchers to make it possible for apps on mobile devices to notify people if they were recently in proximity to someone who was infected . But some health officials worry about leaving this delicate job in the hands of tech companies known for privacy violations . `` I find it hard to believe an undocumented patient would be comfortable with an app that alerts you to someone next to you that has been exposed to COVID , '' said the director of a nonprofit health clinic . The Trump administration wo n't disclose how it is distributing medical supplies brought to the U.S. at taxpayer expense , instead allowing the six medical supply companies doing the importing to block public release of the data , according to the Federal Emergency Management Agency . The lack of disclosure effectively hinders any public accounting of which states are getting the most help and what formulas are being used to distribute the equipment , despite a public investment of tens of millions of dollars in the airlift operation . The administration also wo n't give details on the financial terms the White House struck with the six companies , which together reported more than $ 2 billion in profits last year . Warning that the supply chain of the North American free-trade zone could be permanently crippled , the U.S. is pushing Mexico to reopen factories that were closed because of the country 's social distancing guidelines . Under pressure from the Trump administration and American CEOs , some Mexican officials have begun to cave , despite warnings from Mexican health authorities that reopening factories too soon could lead to widespread death . `` They are criminals who are only interested in their capital , '' said a worker at a factory owned by Wisconsin-based Regal Beloit Corp. . Your questions answered Today 's question comes from Brenda Reismann , who wants to know : Will banks suspend mortgage payments ? Business reporter Andrew Khouri has the latest on navigating mortgage relief . Under the federal CARES Act , a borrower with a federally backed mortgage is entitled to cease paying their mortgage for six months as part of forbearance programs , as long as the homeowner has faced financial hardship from the pandemic . If you want to take advantage , you must request relief from your mortgage servicer , the company to which you make your payment each month . There is n't a threshold as to the level of hardship you must face . And you do n't have to submit documentation proving your hardship . After six months , if you want , you can request an additional six-month break from paying , bringing your total forbearance period to a year . According to the federal Consumer Financial Protection Bureau , there should be no additional fees , penalties or additional interest charged to you because of your forbearance . Remember though , the payments are postponed , not forgiven . You 'll have to make up the payments after the forbearance period is over , but you wo n't have to pay it all back in a lump sum if you ca n't afford to do so . Other options include paying a higher mortgage payment each month until all your missed payments are accounted for , or extending the length of your loan and keeping your monthly mortgage payment the same or even lower than before the forbearance .

One local restaurant is making the tough decision to stick to take-out only , despite having the green light to reopen their dining area . `` I think it 's a good idea for some of these restaurants to stay closed , '' said customer Cory James . In an effort to protect its employees and customers , Farolito Restaurant on Cottonwood Street will continue to serve take-out only . `` We decided with the numbers still so high here in Abilene and continuing to rise every day , just for the safety of all of our employees and our customers we 're just gon na wait and see if the numbers level out and start to go down , '' said Manager of Farolito Restaurant Kendra Sartor . A lot of factors went into this decision , including the economic hardships their restaurant and employees are facing . `` It was a hard decision to make , because like you said everyone needs their jobs and money to support their families , but we just thought it was a lot safer to just continue to wait , '' said Sartor .

With Fury being idle because of the shutdown of the sport , he 's gotten a brief glimpse of what like will be like after he retires from boxing . The unbeaten Fury -LRB- 30-0-1 , 21 KOs -RRB- feels that he might as well continue fighting into his 40s because there 's nobody in the heavyweight division that can beat him . It 's going to be hard for anyone to beat the 6 ' 9 ″ Fury now that he 's back at the top of his game , and in excellent condition . Right now , Fury may already be the best heavyweight on the planet . We 'll have to see if Fury can keep it together mentally and not come apart as he did after his win over Wladimir Klitschko in 2015 . The 31-year-old Fury believes he just beat the best heavyweight in WBC champion Deontay Wilder -LRB- 42-1-1 , 41 KOs -RRB- last February to take his title . `` I 'm going to fight on till I 'm 40 years old , '' Fury said to ESPN . `` I 've been thinking about it , and there is n't much else to do anyway . So yeah , I may as well keep fighting . `` I do n't see anyone out there that can challenge me anyway . I just flattened the best one out there , the toughest opponent out there is Deontay Wilder , and we all saw what happened to him the last time out . '' Fury and Wilder will be fighting a trilogy match in the fall , as long as crowds are able to attend boxing events . That 's not up to them . It 'll be decided by the government . Whatever Fury says about his longterm future right now has to be taken with a grain of salt . He changes his mind a lot , and he a completely different perspective if he gets starched in his first fight after lockdown against Wilder . The way that Fury fought Wilder last time , he 'll be at risk if he continues to do that in the future . Fury went right at Wilder and surprised him with his aggressiveness . Even if it works again for Fury to fight that way , he 'll have problems in the future against guys like Anthony Joshua . On Thursday , ESPN reported that Fury 's management was in negotiations with the management of IBF/WBA/WBO heavyweight champion Anthony Joshua for a unification fight in December in the Middle East . However , Joshua 's promoter Eddie Hearn quashed the rumor , saying that there are no negotiations going on with Fury 's management . Joshua is still under contract to face his IBF mandatory Kubrat Pulev next . Fury still needs to face Wilder in a trilogy match . Wilder executed his rematch clause in his contract last February after his loss to him by an eighth-round knockout .

As John Ziegler , Newport 's AD at the time , recalls , `` We had set up all those county tournaments , which were well-attended , and we had accumulated more money than we were used to having , than was prudent to have around . '' Rather than pass the excess cash back to the schools , the ADs considered how to put it to its best use . `` Gary -LRB- Shipp of Greenwood -RRB- and JE -LRB- Smith , Susquenita -RRB- were the deans of the association . They were the driving forces . When Spike -LRB- Temple -RRB- came on board , we started pulling in the same direction , '' Ziegler explained . `` I do n't remember whose idea it was , but we came up with having a luncheon to recognize six scholar-athletes from each school and award a $ 250 book scholarship to two students from each of the four schools . '' Twenty-four years later , PCADA has honored 192 county student-athletes with plaques and , thanks to the Owls Club , which has underwritten the program for eight years and $ 80,000 , handed out over $ 125,000 in scholarships . `` We have a unique situation with four schools in one county , '' Ziegler said . `` I 'm not taking credit -LRB- for the scholarships -RRB- , but it 's one of the great things we did . I 'm proud of the Perry County AD scholarship program . '' As he should . Over the years , the county ADs have recognized a who 's who of special talents . This year 's class is equally star-studded . In alphabetical order , they include ... Mandi Armstrong , Susquenita A four-year starter on the Blackhawk basketball team , Armstrong was on track to pick up her fourth letter in softball . On the court , she was a solid contributor , willing to do whatever her teammates needed done . On the diamond , she was an instant star , playing any spot in the infield and providing a power bat in the middle of the lineup . Armstrong is headed to Lebanon Valley College to play softball . Aaron Bollinger , Greenwood A three-year starter in baseball , Bollinger helped the Wildcats get to the PIAA-A championship game . He started at short , took a regular turn in the pitching rotation and hit for power and average . Bollinger earned three letters in basketball , emerging as a senior as the team 's top scorer . He also answered the call of the soccer team , coming out as a senior to play goalie . Bollinger will continue his athletic and academic career at Juniata where he will play baseball . Jaylan Cockley , West Perry The Mustang senior had a star-crossed career . A starter as a freshman on the soccer team , Cockley suffered a knee injury that cost her junior year and impacted her senior season . The knee injury also cost her a year of basketball , but she returned to run the point for the Mustangs . A heady , energetic athlete , Cockley will play soccer at Penn State-Harrisburg . Kaleb Keefe , Susquenita A two-sport athlete , Keefe was an integral part of the Blackhawk cross country and baseball programs . He will be attending Susquehanna University with a major in finance . Emily Kline , Newport The ultimate grinder , Kline earned 11 letters , four each in field hockey and basketball , and three in track . A tireless worker , Kline made her mark in field hockey , helping control the midfield and jumping into the offense to score or assist on goals . In track , she was a three-year fixture running the two-mile , a race for only the most willing . Kline also stuck with basketball -- others in her class did n't -- and led the Buffaloes in rebounding her senior year . She will attend Lebanon Valley College and play field hockey . Liam Moyer , West Perry Moyer patiently waited his turn to earn starting assignments in soccer and basketball . A coach 's son , Moyer could be counted on to be in the right place and make the smart play . His head 's - up rebound and pass set up Jordan Erbacher 's buzzer-beating , game-deciding 3-pointer in the Mustangs ' Perry County boys ' semifinal win over Greenwood . Moyer was also a starting midfielder on West Perry 's county soccer championship squad . Moyer is undecided on his choice of colleges . He is considering Bucknell and Penn State . Glenn Rice , Greenwood A Newport student , Rice was a blessing to two Wildcat programs , soccer and track . A four-time letter winner , Rice was a fixture on three PC soccer tournament champs . He finished his career with 108 points and 46 goals , including the game-winner in the 2018 Tri-Valley League title game . On the track , Rice was a dependable source of distance points . He will continue his soccer career at DeSales . Kelsey Sheaffer , Greenwood The third Sheaffer to earn a PCADA scholarship , Kelsey made her mark between the posts for the Wildcat ' field hockey program . Sheaffer , a three-year starter in goal , backstopped three county-tournament champs and three TVL champs . In 2018 , she was in the cage for the program 's first state title . A year later , she capped her career with a program-first District 3A championship . Sheaffer will continue her education at Florida International , where she will major in International Business .", "url": "https://www.pennlive.com/perry-county-times/2020/05/perry-ads-honor-best-and-brightest-student-athletes.html", "kws": ["special^^talents", "athletic^^director", "basketball", "scholarships", "baseball^^programs", "school^^year", "West^^Perry^^Moyer", "students", "colleges", "field^^hockey", "softball", "schools", "Emily^^Kline", "soccer", "Kaleb^^Keefe", "Liam^^Moyer", "Lebanon^^Valley^^College", "Bucknell", "Aaron^^Bollinger", "Shipp"], "text_category": {"first_cat": {"Sports": 1.0000100135803223}, "second_cat": {"Sports_Other": 1.0000100135803223}}, "ne_content_person": {"Gary": 1, "Greenwood": 5, "Jaylan Cockley": 1, "Smith": 1, "Kelsey": 1, "Liam Moyer": 1, "Kaleb Keefe": 1, "Jordan Erbacher": 1, "Bollinger": 3, "Kline": 3, "Kelsey Sheaffer": 1, "John Ziegler": 1, "West Perry Moyer": 1, "Armstrong": 1, "Aaron Bollinger": 1, "Ziegler": 2, "Moyer": 3, "Shipp": 1, "Emily Kline": 1, "Sheaffer": 3, "Glenn Rice": 1, "Keefe": 1, "Cockley": 2, "Rice": 3}, "src": "PennLive.com", "c_word": 997, "para_count": null, "para_length": null, "image_count": 8, "geotag": [{"name": "perry county", "score": 0.9902535080909729, "coord": "40.371376,-77.240515", "pid": "perry_county,pennsylvania", "type": "county"}], "title_c_count": 9}

Initially conceived as an affordable , introductory 35mm single lens reflex film camera , the K1000 quickly caught on with student photographers , both for its price and for its simplicity . It was its lack of automation of any kind that made it such a powerful tool for teachers and students . Reporters need cameras as well , since photographers are n't always available , and the K1000 was a good fit at our paper . The K1000s we had sitting around on reporter 's desks were always equipped with 50mm lenses , both the heavier , brighter f/1 .4 and the cheaper , lighter f/2 .0 . These lenses provided a `` normal '' field of view -LRB- akin to human vision -RRB- . The large maximum aperture of these lenses did everyone a big favor we do n't really appreciate today : it gave us a nice bright viewfinder image that made it a lot easier to focus , and the shallow depth of field of these lenses helped the image in the viewfinder `` pop , '' meaning it was either in focus or it was well out of focus . We take this favor for granted today because of advances in focusing screens , electronic viewfinders and autofocus . A neat trick from that era was known , at least at The Ada News , as `` robbing out '' a roll of film . A reporter would photograph an award winner or a gardener with a big turnip , using only a few frames of film . He or she would leave the camera on my desk with a note saying something like , `` Bill F. with donated bike , please rob . '' Robbing a roll of film meant I would turn out the lights , open the camera , cut off the frames to be developed and process them , then put the remaining film back in the camera . We could sometimes get three or even four photo sessions on one roll of film that way , and the reporters did n't have to wait to fill up an entire roll of film , which they could n't on deadline . The film in these cameras for most of their lives was Kodak Tri-X , the universal 400 ISO black-and-white photographic film in newsrooms throughout the world for decades until the era of color arrived in the late 1980s and early 1990s . The news business is n't kind to cameras , but from my perspective , that 's not a bad thing .

Rebel Wilson is thriving in quarantine ! The Australian actress , 40 , took to Instagram on May 2 to share pics of her at-home photoshoot -- and she looked incredible ! While in lockdown amid the coronavirus pandemic in Sydney , Rebel took a series of snaps showing off her slimmed-down figure in a light blue tracksuit . `` I call this series : At Home with Rebel , '' she captioned the carousel post , in which she wore pants and an unzipped hoodie , exposing her black bra . In the first snap , she totally looked like a model as she posed on top of her chic white sofa , and smized like a pro ! In the second pic , the Pitch Perfect actress stood in front of her camera with her leg popped out to the size and her blonde tresses styled into pretty curls , falling below her shoulders . Finally , she channeled her now-iconic role in Cats for the third pic as she crawled towards the camera . Rebel 's personal trainer Jono Castano Acero applauded her self-timer shoot and commented `` yes '' along with several fire emojis . The Aussie star recently got in an intense outside workout , going toe-to-toe with Jono at a park in Sydney . After exercising with some workout bands , Rebel strapped on her boxing gloves for a sparring session . After losing so much weight before COVID-19 , it appears Rebel was n't going to let a pandemic ruin her workout routine . Rebel revealed her dramatic 40-pound weight loss at the 2019 premiere of Muriel 's Wedding : The Musical in Melbourne , Australia . Ever since then , she has basked in the glory of her hard work with every public appearance . View this post on Instagram I call this series : At Home with Rebel A post shared by Rebel Wilson -LRB- @rebelwilson -RRB- on May 1 , 2020 at 11:11 pm PDT Her transformation is all due to diet and exercise , according to Jono Castano Acero . `` I encourage all my clients to do an extra bit of cardio during the day to keep moving , '' Rebels trainer told HollywoodLife in an EXCLUSIVE interview . `` A little tip is to get a watch or use your phone to count steps and aim for 10 thousand steps a day . If you 're on 9000 steps at 10pm , you have to get it done . '' The fitness guru said that Rebel is `` one of the sweetest souls I 've ever met , '' and that the two usually end up burning some extra calories in their sessions -- from all the laughing !", "url": "https://hollywoodlife.com/2020/05/02/rebel-wilson-weight-loss-at-home-photo-shoot/", "kws": ["Rebel^^Wilson", "workout^^routine", "Instagram", "pretty^^curls", "pics", "Rebels^^trainer", "Weight", "pic", "camera", "bra", "Pitch^^Perfect", "cardio", "pants", "Aussie", "HollywoodLife", "Home", "Cats", "Melbourne", "Sydney", "coronavirus"], "text_category": {"first_cat": {"ArtsEntertainment": 1.0000048875808716, "Lifestyle": 0.9998121857643127}, "second_cat": {"ArtsEntertainment_Celebrities": 1.0000048875808716, "Lifestyle_Fitness": 0.9998121857643127}}, "ne_content_person": {"Wilson": 2, "Jono Castano Acero": 2, "Jono": 1, "HollywoodLife": 1, "Muriel": 1, "Rebel Wilson": 1}, "src": "Hollywood Life", "c_word": 484, "para_count": 8.0, "para_length": 60.5, "image_count": 1, "geotag": [], "title_c_count": 18}

Please support local journalism by subscribing to The Providence Journal . One showed new coronavirus hospitalizations over March and April in Rhode Island . The chart showed the line getting flatter two weeks after many businesses were shuttered . That meant that while more people were being hospitalized every day , the numbers were n't growing as quickly as they had . The line got even flatter two weeks after she issued her stay-at-home order . But some outliers in late April were way above the plateau . The unusual increases in hospitalizations came about two weeks after the Passover and Easter holidays , when , she believes , many people may have gotten together , contrary to her rules on gatherings , and exposed themselves to the virus . Two weeks is significant because it takes about that long for someone who is exposed to the coronavirus to show symptoms of COVID-19 and to get tested for it , state officials say . `` If , in two weeks from today , we see a spike that leads to people getting sicker , it 's because we went out this weekend on a beautiful weekend and got together when we really should n't , '' Raimondo said . A second chart showed where the state could go in the next two weeks . One line projected a sharp decline in current hospitalizations , nearly mirroring the sharp increases the state saw in March and April . The lines are roughly symmetrical , creating a shape like a bell . The other showed a more gradual decline in people in the hospital with COVID-19 , remaining at a high plateau for longer . Rhode Island was still at a plateau right now , Raimondo said . Some other areas had seen sharp declines after plateauing ; others , like Massachusetts , remained stubbornly high for weeks . `` The truth is , we 're not exactly sure if we will have a sustained plateau with an eventual decline , or more of a traditional bell curve , '' Raimondo said . `` What we do know is that it 's likely to be one of those two courses and it 's not likely to start moving upward again .

State Health Director Dr. Nicole Alexander-Scott said that one of those people who died was in their 40s , one was in their 50s , two in their 60s , five in their 70s , four in their 80s and four in their 90s . Fifteen of the 17 coronavirus deaths reported on Saturday were residents of congregate care settings , a category that includes nursing homes . Of 296 coronavirus-related deaths reported in Rhode Island so far , about 215 have been residents of nursing homes , or more than 70 % . `` This is our topmost priority , being able to address the fact that we have a precious older population and a virus that transmits very easily when people are close together , '' Alexander-Scott said . On its website , the department also reported 327 new cases , raising the total during the pandemic to 9,289 . The number of new cases was down from 341 reported Friday , but the number of people whose deaths were reported rose from 13 on Friday . The department also reported 333 people with COVID-19 , the respiratory ailment caused by the coronavirus , were in the hospital . Of those , 80 were in intensive care , with 54 on ventilators . Those numbers compared to Friday 's reported totals of 352 in the hospital , 76 in intensive care and 51 on ventilators . Raimondo on Saturday also reported the establishment of a $ 1.5 million fund that will give grants of up to $ 5,000 to low-income renters at the risk of becoming homeless because they have n't been able to pay rent . The money can be used to pay past-due rent and fees , not for current rent payments , the governor said .

In the early 1600s , English explorer John Smith described the Potomac River as an Edenic waterway teeming with wildlife . Early colonists also reported gargantuan sturgeon and massive schools of fish -- and at his waterside estate , Mount Vernon , George Washington himself had three commercial fisheries on the Potomac River . Originating in the Allegheny Highlands of West Virginia , the Potomac River 's watershed encompasses 15,000 square miles , spreading over the District of Columbia , and four different states -- Maryland , Pennsylvania , Virginia , and West Virginia . The 380 mile waterway is the second largest tributary feeding the Chesapeake Bay , the biggest estuary in America , and one of most productive bodies of water on earth , home to 3,600 species of plants and animals . But , in the centuries following the colonial period , untreated sewage , agricultural runoff , and industrial discharge took a toll on the river -- and wildlife suffered . These days , though , the Potomac River is recovering . The Clean Water Act in 1972 , followed by the creation of the Environmental Protection Agency 's Chesapeake Bay Program in 1983 , catalyzed more than five decades of restoration effort and policy change , including stricter mandates on nutrient input and improvements in urban waste management , leading to a decline in the river 's primary pollutants -- nitrogen , phosphorus , and sediment . Once-imperiled species , including bald eagles , osprey , and American shad have returned to the waterway . And now , researchers are also documenting significant numbers of common bottlenose dolphins in the lower portion of the Potomac River . Found in tropical and temperate waters worldwide , bottlenose dolphins are among the most common cetaceans on the planet . The marine mammals are encountered in both offshore and coastal waters , including bays , gulfs , and estuaries . While they are not an endangered species , bottlenose dolphins are vulnerable to human disturbance , and are threatened by habitat alteration , diseases , pollution , and the accumulation of biotoxins . According to the Marine Mammal Protection Act , five different bottlenose dolphin populations encountered along the Atlantic Coast are considered depleted . Bottlenose dolphins are also among the most frequently studied marine mammals on the planet , and the cetaceans have been have been documented at the mouth of the Chesapeake Bay , and along the coastline of southern Virginia and Maryland . However , little is known about the bottlenose dolphins frequenting the Chesapeake Bay 's tributaries . `` There are a lot of dolphins here , '' says Ann-Marie Jacoby , associate director of the Potomac-Chesapeake Dolphin Project . `` Since 2015 , we have identified over 1,000 animals , and about 30 percent of those we see year after year . So , it suggests that they 're coming back to this area , they 're using it . '' The Potomac-Chesapeake Dolphin Project is a research initiative directed by Dr. Janet Mann , a professor of biology and psychology at Georgetown University . It has been cataloging the region 's roving bottlenose dolphins for the last five summers . From May through October every year , the project surveys a 14-square mile swath of the Potomac River near Chesapeake Bay , from a research station located on Virginia 's Northern Neck peninsula . A team of graduate students collects data on the dolphins frequenting the area -- which includes photographing the dorsal fins of individual dolphins . Images of the animals observed in the Potomac River are added to the Mid-Atlantic Bottlenose Dolphin Catalog curated by researchers at Duke University . The massive catalog identifies individual bottlenose dolphins and is shared by cetacean researchers along the entire East Coast . So far , the Potomoc dolphins have also been spotted in waters off the coast of Beaufort , North Carolina , Virginia Beach , and Cape May , New Jersey . `` Knowing where else they have been sighted and when they 've been in these other locations gives us more information about which populations they belong to . So far , we 're finding out that there are , it seems , multiple populations using this area -- some that are considered estuarine and some that are coastal animals , '' says Jacoby . The data collected by the Potomac-Chesapeake Dolphin Project suggests two or three different populations -- the Northern Migratory Stock , the Southern Migratory Stock , and the South Carolina-Georgia Stock -- all may be using the Chesapeake Bay and the Potomac River as they migrate along the East Coast of the United States every summer . `` It 's a very important thing to know , because under the Marine Mammal Protection Act these dolphins are being managed by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration -LRB- NOAA -RRB- , and so they are managed in these stocks , or management units , and if you look at those , you 'll see the Chesapeake Bay is pretty much void of data points , '' says Jacoby . `` And we 're finding that there are a lot of dolphins here . '' The frequency of sightings documented by the Potomac-Chesapeake Dolphin Project also suggests the Potomac River and the Chesapeake Bay support an exceptionally high density of bottlenose dolphins . At the outset of the project in 2015 , after 73 hours of observation spread over a 14 day period , the Potomac-Chesapeake Dolphin Project 's researchers were able to identify 193 individual bottlenose dolphins . By comparison , in Western Australia 's Shark Bay , a UNESCO World Heritage Site believed to sustain one of the highest densities of bottlenose dolphins on the planet , researchers would expect to document less than half as many dolphins over the same time period . Researchers are also trying to determine how far up the 405-mile Potomac River the animals are traveling . In July of 1844 , a pod of bottlenose dolphins was spotted cruising the river not far from the capital -- and others have been sighted as far upstream as Alexandria , Virginia , more than 90 miles from the mouth of the Potomac . A survey conducted in the mid-1990s also recorded bottlenose dolphins in other regional waterways , including the Elizabeth and Rappahannock rivers . More recently , the Potomac-Chesapeake Dolphin Project has documented dolphins as far upriver as Dahlgren , Virginia , about 60 miles from Washington , DC . However , much about the dolphins frequenting the Potomac River and Chesapeake Bay remains a mystery . Researchers are still trying to fully understand why the animals are coming , and how long they have been using the waterways . `` Given that we do have this recovering Bay and there have been a lot restoration efforts for over 30 years now , we are seeing a healthier Chesapeake Bay , and specifically , a healthier Potomac River , '' says Jacoby . `` I would n't be surprised if there is an increase in the number of animals coming , but I ca n't say definitively that is the case . '' The dolphins are most abundant in the Potomac River during July and August , when water temperatures peak -- the researchers have even witnessed groups of up to 200 animals in the warm months . Jacoby believes the availability of resources is drawing the dolphins to the Chesapeake Bay and into the Potomac River . The dolphins also may be seeking out the Chesapeake Bay and the lower Potomac River in an effort to avoid predators , such as bull sharks . And , the shallow and sheltered waters of the Potomac River may also provide critical habitat for mating and calving . `` We do see quite a few females and calves , and not just older calves , but also newborns , ' says Jacoby . `` We also see a lot of mating and socializing behavior , so it suggests the area is important for both breeding and birthing . '' On August 17 , 2019 , while following a group of approximately 50 dolphins downriver toward the Chesapeake Bay , in waters near Lewisetta , Virginia , Jacoby even witnessed evidence of a wild dolphin birth -- something rarely seen by researchers . Although bottlenose dolphins are among the most studied marine mammals on earth , the only other wild birth documented by scientists was in 2013 , off the coast of Georgia . The scientists are also recording social behavior in an effort to better understand how diseases are transmitted and contracted by bottlenose dolphins . In 2015 , the Potomac-Chesapeake Dolphin Project began as a pilot study following an unusual mortality event caused by a type of morbillivirus . From 2013 to 2015 , more than 1,600 bottlenose dolphins stranded along the East Coast between Florida and New York . During the mortality event , the largest increase in annual strandings occurred in the Chesapeake Bay region , with Virginia documenting more stranded bottlenose dolphins than any other state -- a total of 538 animals . `` We are particularly interested in assessing the consequences of this disease outbreak and possible future outbreaks so that we can make sure populations are healthy , '' says Jacoby . Another concern for the researchers at the Potomac-Chesapeake Dolphin Project is climate change , which is already impacting the Chesapeake and the Potomac River . Due to land subsidence , sea level is rising at a rate twice the global average in the Chesapeake region , and atolls like Holland 's Island and Sharp 's Island have already been swallowed by water . Temperature changes will also affect aquatic life . In the Chesapeake Bay and the Potomac River , warmer water temperatures lead to lower levels of dissolved oxygen , and can fuel algal blooms . This July , the Potomac River set a new temperature record , reaching 93.7 degrees Fahrenheit , about ten degrees warmer than the average temperature of 84.2 degrees Fahrenheit , and exceeding previous records set in 2011 and 2012 . Climate models for the capital area also project wetter weather in the future -- and already , 2018 was the region 's rainiest year to date . Extreme rainfall in the Washington , DC area has serious implications for the Potomac River and the Chesapeake Bay , as regional flooding causes sediment along with runoff imbued with fertilizer , oil , and other debris to stream into local waterways . The Potomac-Chesapeake Dolphin Project 's researchers still do n't know exactly how the rising and warming Chesapeake Bay , along the increased precipitation projected for the region , will combine to impact bottlenose dolphins and other wildlife . But any increased runoff spurred by higher-than-average rainfall will exacerbate pollution in regional waterways , counteracting decades of restoration and recovery efforts undertaken by federal , state , and local governments , along with non-profit organizations like the Potomac Conservancy . In Western Australia 's Shark Bay , a marine heat wave in 2011 which caused water temperatures to rise more than four degrees above average had long-term impacts on the survival and birth rates of bottlenose dolphins . Following the heat wave , data indicated the survival rate of bottlenose dolphins dropped by 12 percent there . But for now , bottlenose dolphins are still showing up in the Chesapeake Bay and the Potomac River . Many of the regulars have even been nicknamed by the Potomac-Chesapeake Dolphin Project 's researchers . There 's Alexander Hamilton , Jimmy Carter , and Ladybird Johnson , among others . The dolphin born in the Potomac River in mid-August has already been assigned a moniker too -- the baby has been dubbed Gwendolyn Mink , and its mother named for Patsy Mink , the first woman of color elected to the United States Congress .", "url": "https://www.earthisland.org/journal/index.php/articles/entry/bottlenose-dolphins-potomac-river/", "kws": ["Potomac^^River", "East^^Coast^^waterways", "Virginia^^Beach", "Chesapeake^^Bay", "West^^Virginia", "bays", "regional^^waterways", "coastal^^animals", "Maryland", "wildlife", "North^^Carolina", "bottlenose^^dolphins", "sheltered^^waters", "fish", "aquatic^^life", "individual^^bottlenose^^dolphins", "George^^Washington", "individual^^dolphins", "Alexandria", "Beaufort"], "text_category": {"first_cat": {"Science": 1.0000100135803223, "Lifestyle": 0.9995893836021423, "Society": 0.5117461681365967}, "second_cat": {"Society_Advocacy": 0.5117461681365967, "Lifestyle_PetsAnimals": 0.9995893836021423}, "third_cat": {"Society_Advocacy_Other": 0.5117461681365967, "Lifestyle_PetsAnimals_Wildlife": 0.9995893836021423}}, "ne_content_person": {"John Smith": 1, "Ann-Marie Jacoby": 1, "Ladybird Johnson": 1, "George Washington": 1, "Patsy Mink": 1, "Alexander Hamilton": 1, "Elizabeth": 1, "Dahlgren": 1, "Gwendolyn Mink": 1, "Jimmy Carter": 1, "Janet Mann": 1, "Jacoby": 7, "Bay": 1}, "src": "earthisland.org", "c_word": 2032, "para_count": 25.0, "para_length": 81.28, "image_count": 2, "geotag": [], "title_c_count": 7}

Largely based in and around Rome , enhanced measures have been introduced that will allow for filming to pick back up as the coronavirus continues to expand across the globe . While it 's back to work for some Italian filmmakers , it 's far from business as usual . While they 'll be allowed to film , the country 's social distancing measures will continue to be implemented . On top of that , all cast and crew involved in the production on the film sets will be required to be tested for COVID-19 prior to returning to work . While on set , temperatures will be taken on a continual basis and all cast and crew not actively filming will have to wear facemasks . Not just that , but each production and soundstage will be required to provide training on the regulations surrounding its protective and sanitation equipment . Each production company must also include access to the doctor . As Italy was the one country hit hardest in Europe , the movers and shakers from Hollywood are all but guaranteed to be following the situation closely as virtually all productions across the United States remain paused from the time being . With production still shutdown across the board in Hollywood , the dominoes fell in such a way that essentially forces the theater industry to shut down throughout the duration of the summer blockbuster season . While some states have already started rolling out their reopening procedures , most national chains have opted to remain closed until studios agree to begin exhibiting movies once again . A catch-22 if there 's ever been one , studios likely wo n't bump up any release dates while the vast majority of states remained closed and under stay-at-home orders , leading theaters to remain closed until they 're confident movie-goers will begin showing up once again . Even then , it stands to reasons consumer confidence might not fully return for months afterward . The latest frustrations have resulted in a battle between Universal and AMC Theatres , after the latter pledged to no longer show Universal films so long as they put an increased emphasis on moving features straight to video-on-demand . Universal pulled a move like that with Trolls : World Tour , a decision that has reportedly netted the company upwards of $ 100 million . `` Our goal in releasing Trolls : World Tour on PVOD was to deliver entertainment to people who are sheltering at home , while movie theatres and other forms of outside entertainment are unavailable , '' Universal Pictures shared in a response statement , per Variety . `` Based on the enthusiastic response to the film , we believe we made the right move . In fact , given the choice of not releasing Trolls : World Tour , which would not only have prevented consumers from experiencing the movie but also negatively impacted our partners and employees , the decision was clear .

However , at almost 40 years old and on an expiring contract , we do n't know if Miller will be back next season . The Ducks already have a great starter in John Gibson and should they need to find a new backup goalie , he 'd only need to be able to play 20-25 games . Here are five options for a backup goalie if Ryan Miller retires . AARON DELL Dell bounced back in the second half of the season , after a rough start to the year and a horrible 2018-19 season . He had a .907 save percentage this year and played 33 games , almost taking over the starting job from Martin Jones . He 's gone through some very poor stretches over the last two seasons , so if the Ducks have to resort to free agency for a backup , Dell should n't be the target , though he is at least an option . THOMAS GREISS Greiss is a potential target for the Ducks because he 's likely going to be pushed out of New York with the arrival of Ilya Sorokin . He posted a .913 save percentage this year and has almost split time with both Semyon Varlamov and Robin Lehner over the last two seasons . He 's shown that he can be effective while playing a high number of games , though that 's not really necessary with Gibson as a starter . He also may come at a higher price than many of these other UFA options . ANTON KHUDOBIN If you 're looking for a star backup , Khudobin is the guy . After posting a .923 save percentage last season , he followed it up with an excellent .930 save percentage this year . He 's also played 71 games over the last two seasons , showing that like Greiss , he can play a high number of games . Again though , there is n't really a need for someone who can play 30 or more games , plus Khudobin has been great for Dallas and certainly could be re-signed . ANTHONY STOLARZ Stolarz may be one of the most likely options for the Ducks . The issue with all these free agent goalies is that , with the exception of Thomas Greiss , there 's a good chance each is re-signed and never hits the market . Stolarz actually had a very strong season with San Diego , posting a .922 save percentage in 39 games . He was also good in his single start with the Ducks this year , allowing just two goals on 36 shots against St. Louis just before the season was paused . Stolarz has only played 26 games and while he 's probably not Anaheim 's first choice , with one year still remaining on his contract , he 's definitely a possibility . CAM TALBOT Other than a poor 2018-19 season , Talbot has , for the most part , been a good goalie at the NHL level . He was great this season with Calgary , managing a .919 save percentage over 26 games . We 've seen he fits well as a backup and he 's not going to get more than a two-year deal , so if Miller retires , he 'll be one of the better options in free agency , should he get there . Here ' today 's poll question -LRB- results and discussion will be posted tomorrow -RRB- : Of these options , who would you want to see as Anaheim 's backup if Ryan Miller retires ?

She was probably going to win . In her time as a Mohawk , Welch , whose name is now Jennifer Farrell , racked up several trophy cases worth of hardware , making it to 12 state championship meets in three different sports . Farrell graduated from Mason City in 1988 , and this September will be inducted as a member of the 2020 class of the school 's Athletic Hall of Fame . This will be the second consecutive year that Farrell has been honored . Last September , Farrell was honored as a member of the 1987 and 1988 Mason City swim and dive teams that won the first two of its three consecutive state titles . In her senior year , Farrell finished in second place in the all-around at the state gymnastics meet , and won a state title with a first place finish in the balance beam . In track and field that year , Farrell was a member of the 1988 shuttle hurdle relay team that set a state-best time of 1:03.12 that season , and broke her own school record with a time of 1:07.75 in the 400-meter hurdles . She was also named a High School All-American as a member of the diving team , where she placed second at the state meet her senior year . In 1988 , she and Tim Klapperich of St. Ansgar were named the Globe Gazette Athletes of the Year . `` She had all the quality it takes to be really good , '' former Mason City gymnastics coach Jim Dlouhy said . `` She had a great work ethic , she was motivated , she did n't settle for less than the best of what she could do . She had natural athletic ability . '' Farrell , who now works as a physical therapist in Superior , Wisconsin , is understandably proud of the fact that she made it to the state meet in every season of each high school sport in which she participated , for a total of 12 state competitions . With that came some challenges though , as she usually had to begin the next sport 's season playing catch up . `` If you go to state , that overlaps the next sport by about two weeks , '' Farrell said . `` I was n't able to start with everybody else every year . Whatever the next sport was , I was always two weeks late starting in . '' In swim and dive , Farrell and fellow Mason City swimmer Deb Ray comprised the `` Dynamic Duo , '' as the pair racked up wins for the Mohawks and pushed each other to be their best . `` We had a unique relationship both as teammates and as competitors , '' Farrell said . `` We really drove each other to higher levels of ability , just because we were so competitive yet friendly . We pushed each other . '' Farrell 's skills in the pool and on the mat also helped lead her to success on the track . Mason City track coach John McKay remembers her as one of the team 's most dependable athletes . `` She had really good body control over the hurdles , '' McKay said . `` We always said that the gymnasts were the ones you 'd want to recruit for things like that . '' On paper , her diving career is probably what she received the most attention for , but Farrell 's first love was gymnastics . In fact , the most special memory of her high school career came during her senior gymnastics season . Before Farrell 's senior year , Mason City coach Jim Dlouhy retired , leaving the status of the season and the program uncertain . Since Farrell was planning on doing gymnastics in college , her father John took the job and helped lead the one-person team to the state title in the balance beam . Her practice facilities were not exactly state of the art , but Farrell worked with what she had . `` I went to my dad 's gym at Roosevelt Elementary after school every day to do beam '' Farrell said . `` We 'd get one beam to put up on the stage so I could practice there . Then we drove to the high school so I could practice on the wrestling mat with the wrestlers , doing floor exercise . '' Farrell did n't have access at either training facility to bars or vaults equipment , so all she could do was visualize her routine , work on her grip strength , and hope for the best at meets . Despite that disadvantage , she still finished second in the all-around event at state . `` When I went to meets , I did all four events , and competed in the all-around event , but I just had no bars or vaults to practice on all year , '' Farrell said . `` It was pretty special to get second on all-around despite not having the equipment , and the fact that my dad coached me to that level . '' Dlouhy remembers Farrell as an athlete that took his gymnastics program to new heights . `` Jennifer was the first gymnast I had that had that type of ability , '' Dlouhy said . `` We took what we had been doing in gymnastics to a little bit higher level than before . Not only was Jennifer learning , I was learning , because I had to teach and coach her on things that I 'd never done before . '' After graduating from Mason City , Farrell attended Gustavus Adolphus College , where she competed as a gymnast for three seasons , sitting out her senior season due to an internship at the Mayo Clinic . She currently lives and works in Superior with her husband , Matt , and their son , Brendan . As she looks back on her high school career and prepares for the ceremony that will hopefully occur in the fall , she credits her teammates , parents and coaches for pushing her to a championship level . `` I worked really hard at all the sports that I was in , '' Farrell said . `` I had great teammates , so it was n't always a grind . It was truly fun to work .

Pogba had made just eight appearances for United this season before the health crisis forced the suspension of the Premier League in March . The French World Cup winner has n't played a single match in 2020 due to his persistent ankle problems . His last appearance came in a December 26 win over Newcastle , but Pogba has been keeping fit during the virus break and hopes to be ready if the Premier League can return in the summer . `` I have a little home gym in my house , '' Pogba told United 's website . `` I can do some training , some running , some bike , go outside and do some things with the ball . I am just keeping busy and keeping healthy . `` We have got to stay motivated , there is no other choice . It is a period and we do n't know until when it will be like this , but I still have goals in my head and one day hopefully this -LRB- pandemic -RRB- will stop . `` And then we have to get back on the pitch , so we have to be ready . `` For myself , I have been out for a long time as well , so for me I just want to come back playing football . '' Pogba , 27 , has been in regular contact with his United team-mates during the lockdown as they follow the club 's fitness regime from home . Linked with a move away from fifth-placed United earlier this season , Pogba 's presence would boost their bid for Champions League qualification if matches can be played again eventually . `` My advice first of all is to stay safe , stay at home and keep practising , '' Pogba said . `` There is always a way to work , you can work with anything you have at home , you can still do sit-ups , push-ups .

Despite their name , an expert says they 're ` probably not going to kill anyone , do n't panic ' . More than two inches long with an orange-yellow head and armed with a potent venom , there 's no doubt these buzzing villains are scary . However , Asian giant hornets are n't out to kill us -- they 're more interested in wiping out the honeybee population , who are defenceless to their spiky mandibles . Since November 2019 , there have been multiple sightings of the species across the US and Canada , prompting alarm among researchers . It may be the world 's largest hornet , and yes , it can kill you in some circumstances , but let 's digest the facts of the matter before freaking out . In Japan , ` murder hornets ' kill up to 50 people per year . However , this is mostly due to the neurotoxin in their venom , which can induce symptoms of a potentially deadly allergic reaction , such as anaphalactic shock . Other complications as a result of a sting , such as respiratory and kidney failure , are exceedingly rare . Following two confirmed sightings of the predator , and recurring reports of swathes of decapitated bees , Washington state 's Department of Agriculture has been on ` a full-scale hunt ' to combat bees becoming even more endangered . Chris Looney , an entomologist from the department , told The New York Times : ` This is our window to keep it from establishing , if we ca n't do it in the next couple of years , it probably ca n't be done . ' However , Looney also noted to USA Today they 're ` probably not going to murder someone ... do n't panic ' . If faced with a giant hornet or , god forbid , a hive , there 's very specific advice you should follow . Looney explained to CNN : Do n't try to take them out yourself if you see them . If you get into them , run away , then call us ! It is really important for us to know of every sighting , if we 're going to have any hope of eradication . Conrad Bérubé , a beekeeper and entomologist , had been assigned to track down and exterminate a hive on Vancouver Island last year . Dressed in shorts , thick sweatpants and a bee suit , his protective clothing was no match for the might of the hornets , who attacked him as he approached . He ended up with seven stings , some of which drew blood , and described the ambush as ` having red-hot thumbtacks being driven into my flesh ' . Todd Murray , a Washington State University Extension entomologist and specialist of invasive species , said in a statement : ` We need to teach people how to recognize and identify this hornet while populations are small , so that we can eradicate it while we still have a chance .

As many as 10 competitors vie for a championship opportunity while putting themselves in great danger for the sake of entertainment . This year , however , Vince McMahon and the rest of the WWE upper brass have decided to the hold a Corporate Ladder Match instead when Money In The Bank airs on May 10 . But what in the hell is a Corporate Ladder Match ? Well , according to WWE , this year 's Money In The Bank matches will be held at WWE corporate headquarters in beautiful downtown Stamford , Connecticut , where participants will start at the bottom floor and work their way up to the roof where the briefcases containing the Money In The Bank contracts will be hanging above a ring . Surprisingly enough , this is n't the most absurd gimmick match WWE has introduced over the course of the past 50 or so years , not in the slightest . So , as we prepare ourselves for the upcoming Corporate Ladder Match , let 's take a stroll down memory lane of all the insanely absurd bouts in the history of WWE . First introduced at WrestleMania 21 in 2005 , the Money In The Bank match became so popular that it went from a way to cram as many wrestlers as possible onto the WrestleMania card to its own pay-per-view in 2010 . Custody Ladder Match Here 's where things really go off the rails . Typically , the goal of a ladder match is to secure a championship or an opportunity to fight for one , but sometimes there are more personal prizes hanging high above the ring . Enter the Custody Ladder Match from SummerSlam 2005 where Rey Mysterio and Eddie Guerrero fought for the custody of Mysterio 's real-life son , Dominik . The match was decent enough , but the ludicrous idea of settling a custody dispute with a ladder match at WWE 's annual end of summer event makes the whole mess one of the most absurd matches in the last 15 years . On a more somber note , it was Eddie Guerrero 's final SummerSlam appearance before his untimely death in November 2005 . Sumo Monster Truck Match There have been plenty of sumo matches in the history of professional wrestling , but nothing compares to the high-octane Sumo Monster Truck Match at World Championship Wrestling 's -LRB- later purchased by WWE -RRB- Halloween Havoc in 1995 . And before I get any further , yes , it 's exactly what you think it is . Held on the roof of the TCF Center in Detroit , Michigan , the match consisted of Hulk Hogan and The Giant -LRB- WWE 's Big Show -RRB- , having a sumo-style match while each competitor was behind the wheel of a monster truck . Hogan gained the victory after pushing The Giant 's truck out of the circle , but it did n't stop there . After the conclusion of the spectacle , the wrestlers continued to fight until The Giant fell off the roof . Kennel From Hell Match Anyone who watched wrestling in the late 1990s will tell you that the Attitude Era , while revolutionary , produced some of the worst and questionable matches in the history of wrestling . Sure , the era gave us the rise of Stone Cold Steve Austin , The Rock , and countless others , but man , a few of the concepts introduced were complete and utter trash , like the Kennel From Hell match . Held at the 1999 edition of the Unforgiven pay-per-view event , the match involved Al Snow and Big Boss Man fighting inside a steel cage that was surrounded by another steel cage with a pack of `` vicious '' dogs . Seems intense , right ? Well , the only problem was that all the rottweilers placed outside the ring did n't care about the wrestlers and were more concerned at barking at one another . The match was never brought back . King Of The Road Match You know what 's more dangerous than a wrestling match in a steel cage -- a wrestling match in a steel cage on and 18-wheeler . And that 's exactly what happened during the 1995 Uncensored WCW -LRB- before the promotion was purchased by WWE -RRB- event when Dustin Rhodes battled The Blacktop Bully -LRB- Smash from Demolition -RRB- in the first and only King Of The Road Match . In order to win the match , one of the wrestlers had to climb to the top of the caged-off trailer and sound a horn . Yes , a wrestling match concluded by the sounding of a horn . Here 's a fun fact about the match : both competitors were fired from WCW for breaking the no-bleeding corporate policy , which resulted in Dustin Rhodes returning to WWE where he subsequently debuted his most iconic character , Goldust . The Boneyard Match When the Coronavirus pandemic of 2020 forced WWE to make a last minute change to the annual WrestleMania event , the company elected to hold most of the booked matches at the WWE Performance Center in Orlando instead of cancelling the show outright . One of the biggest matches of the show , the Boneyard Match between The Undertaker and A.J. Styles was n't held in a ring , but in a `` graveyard '' of all places . The bout , which was pre-taped and heavily edited , looked more like an episode of Walker Texas Ranger than a wrestling match , and while I enjoyed myself during the spectacle , this thing was a mess . The aged and grizzled Undertaker could n't climb ladders or other obstacles like he could in the past , so WWE found creative ways of getting past his limited ability . But you can buy some of the dirt from the match on the WWE Shop website . Judy Bagwell On A Forklift Match And then there 's the Judy Bagwell On A Forklift Match from WCW 's New Blood Rising from 2000 where Buff Bagwell defeated Kanyon in a match that was exactly how it sounds . There have been plenty `` On A Pole '' type matches , but nothing ever went as far as this god awful match from the dying days of World Championship Wrestling before the promotion was purchased by WWE in 2001 . The worst part about it is that Judy Bagwell did n't have much of anything to do in the match besides stand on an extended forklift outside the ring . If you do n't pay attention to the middle-aged woman crying from a forklift , you 'd think it was just another terrible late-era WCW match . Those are just a few of the absurd gimmick matches featured on WWE programming before the upcoming Corporate Ladder Match . Will that match be ridiculous as some others on this list ? We 'll have to wait and see .

Rather than performing a routine card trick we 've seen a million times before , Sean Heydon took it to the next level and turned back the time on everyone 's mobile phone . The mind-boggling act had everybody scratching their heads , even Ant and Dec , who both pulled their phones out of their pockets to find that they 'd been done , too . So impressed by the trick , lead judge Simon Cowell stated that ` magic is real ' . The 36-year-old performer came onto the stage and headed down to the judges ' table , telling them that prior to the trick he had asked Ant and Dec to pick out a card and place it face down in the deck . Sean then asked Simon to think of a card before getting each of the judges to mix up a portion of the deck and put them all back together . Then it all goes a bit weird as he had the judges remove their phones and place them face down on the table , telling them that in order for the trick to work he has to ` go back in time ' to before he came on stage . Simon then announced to the audience that he had picked the two of diamonds . Amanda Holden then picked a number between three and ten - she plumped for nine . Picking up his phone , Sean showed the screen to the judges and , incredibly , the clock began to turn back in time a whole nine minutes . Gobsmacked by the spooky trick , the audience , judges , and Ant and Dec all gasped in amazement , before checking their phones . Needless to say , he got through . Speaking to The Metro about his performance , Sean , from Northampton , revealed that it took him two years to learn and perfect the trick . He said : `` That trick that I did on the show , everyone in Northampton has seen me do at weddings and stuff and I was n't sure how it would translate to a bigger audience . `` That specific trick trying to work out how to turn back time on people 's phones and the card trick as well was a couple of years in the planning and taking it to the BGT stage was absolutely phenomenal . '' With skills like this , it makes you wonder why Sean has never entered the competition before . He told the publication that he wanted his act to be just right before bringing it to the popular talent show . And he said the next trick will be even better . He added : `` If I am lucky enough to get through to the next round I want to create something that is n't just going to connect with the audience and the judges , but it 's going to connect with all the people sat watching at home . `` It is going to break that extra wall and it 's going to happen to people at home .

'' Mayor de Blasio said in order for New York City to get back to normal as quickly as possible , the restrictions need to continue , and lifting them has to be done strategically . `` We need to stick with what 's working . We need to understand that the restrictions in place are working and that they only get relaxed carefully and slowly . There 's no on/off switch here .

I have an order in processing that has been in processing so long that I forgot I ordered it until I saw this post and logged into my Children 's Place account . Haha ! About 3 weeks shipping time should be expected . Children 's place is having such awesome deals . My sister is a store manager and basically the warehouses are running out of these items but they have so much in store stock - they just allowed a handful of workers from a handful of stores go in and pull the items to ship .

You do n't want to be the guy who has to call the people telling them something went wrong . You normally ignore that thought because otherwise you 'd be paralyzed by fear . But that 's harder to do when you 're talking about a $ 400,000 Rolls-Royce Cullinan . However , Emme from Roadshow , had the audacity not only to take a Cullinan out for a spin but she entered a desert rally with it . She competed in the Rebelle Rally which is a competition dedicated to women passionate about cars , that takes place in the desert and requires not only skill behind the wheel -LRB- to fend off all sorts of dangers -RRB- but also great orientation skills . Not giving into fear , she pushed the Cullinan way beyond its comfort zone . I mean , sure , the Cullinan is marketed as a ` high-riding ' vehicle , an SUV in normal speak , but nobody actually expects it to be used in the desert , far away from the comfort and safety of good old asphalt . The adventure she went on is , therefore , quite a feat . And there were plenty of challenging times ahead . From an unexpected error regarding the power supply , to a flat tire and a funny power cut due to a slightly open rear door , she and her navigator did a good job . By the end of the rally , the dashboard was showing a lot of warning lights and I would definitely be interested to learn whether it needed some serious work done after it was all said and done . The biggest takeaway though is that the team and the Cullinan managed to win the crossover category , in a car that was considered by many as incredibly out of its league here . I guess the Cullinan does have what it takes to conquer even the toughest environments .

The Warzone community has eagerly awaited news on Duos for many weeks , since it 's now the last of the core squad modes yet to be added to Battle Royale -LRB- although it 's been hinted that five-person squads could be introduced in future too -RRB- . Amos Hodge , creative director at Raven Software , told French publication GamerGen this week that Duos `` is coming '' but suggested there are still bugs that need to be resolved before its eventual release . `` We had Duos on Plunder , but I 'm not sure where Duos is , we got some bugs to work out with Duos , '' he said . `` But we 're listening to the community -- if you noticed , we launched with just Trios , then we added Solos , then we added Quads , so we will get to a place where we add Duos in the future . `` There 's just no exact time I can give you for now , but Duos is coming . You 've already seen in Plunder , but there 's just things we got ta figure out , find the right timing and everything else . '' Free-to-play Warzone has enjoyed a successful debut , with player growth matching the genre 's most prominent games . However , it has been criticised for its frequent removal of key modes . Trios -- the three-person setup the game launched with -- was recently removed and reinstated twice , causing much frustration among the game 's fanbase . Similarly , this week Warzone 's new Most Wanted contract feature was removed just 24 hours after it was added to the game . This was after the feature itself was introduced with the unexpected removal of another contract type , which caused celebrity streamer Tyler ` Ninja ' Blevins to complain in a tweet sent to his 5.7 million followers . Creative director Hodge acknowledged the community reaction to the constant feature switching and explained the developer was trying to create variety while identifying Warzone 's `` core modes . '' `` We 're trying to work with community , listen to their requests , trying to give them what they want , but also keep creating new content , '' he said . `` If you look on Modern Warfare , they 're constantly rotating modes in and out -LSB- ... -RSB- so we 're just trying to find our footing on that , what are the core modes and what we can rotate in and out . '' He added : `` We want to keep players engaged , making new modes , we do n't want the game to get stale , but at the same time , we ca n't have 10 or 15 playlist because people will start to get bad connections , we would n't be able to matchmake -- 150 players is a lot . '' In the same interview Infinity Ward 's studio narrative director , Taylor Kurosaki , said Call of Duty Warzone will `` connect '' the franchise 's various sub-brands such as Modern Warfare and Black Ops in the future .", "url": "https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/call-of-duty-warzone-duos-release/", "kws": ["much-requested^^Duos", "Duty^^Warzone", "Free-to-play^^Warzone", "key^^modes", "bugs", "five-person^^squads", "Raven^^Software", "Trios", "things", "games", "Modern^^Warfare", "Solos", "Call^^of^^Duty", "time", "Quads", "Infinity^^Ward", "Battle^^Royale", "this^^week", "Taylor^^Kurosaki", "people"], "text_category": {"first_cat": {"ArtsEntertainment": 0.9991435408592224}, "second_cat": {"ArtsEntertainment_Other": 0.9991435408592224}}, "ne_content_person": {"Hodge": 1, "Amos Hodge": 1, "Blevins": 1, "Warzone": 1, "Taylor Kurosaki": 1}, "src": "videogameschronicle.com", "c_word": 556, "para_count": 14.0, "para_length": 39.714285714285715, "image_count": 3, "geotag": [], "title_c_count": 19}

The two mid-Hudson Valley residents were otherwise healthy before being diagnosed with COVID-19 , they said . And neither of them know how they contracted the virus . Their stories of surviving the illness that has sparked a pandemic and a statewide pause order are what they and their loved ones have described as a miracle . Nicole Miller , 28 , a hairstylist at Ulta in the Town of Wallkill Miller had a slight fever and a cough in late March . She said she began to feel better , but a few days later she developed a high fever and had the worst body pains she said she had ever experienced . Her cousin , who is a nurse , listened to her breathing on the phone and could hear popping sounds in her lungs . That 's when her husband , Daniel Bennet , rushed her to Orange Regional Medical Center , where she said she was admitted right away . `` It 's so hard to even comprehend you 're going to be on a machine to breathe because you ca n't breathe for yourself , '' Miller said . Bennet , 32 , kept a journal detailing Miller 's treatments , symptoms and status updates . She was put on a ventilator for two days , and was in the hospital for nearly three weeks before finally coming home on Easter Sunday . The young couple lives with Miller 's parents in her childhood home in Montgomery . No one else in the home tested positive for the virus . Aside from being overweight , Miller said she had no other preexisting health conditions that would have contributed to her coronavirus battle . She lost more than 30 pounds while in the hospital . She has already been approved to donate plasma to other COVID-19 patients who are in severe condition , like she was . Those who do n't take social distancing seriously should consider that their loneliness at home now will feel much worse from a hospital bed later , Miller said . `` No one should have to go through what I went through , '' Miller said . `` No one 's family should go through what my family went through . '' Robert Scialpi , 56 , a private equity lender working out of Ellenville Scialpi was on a ventilator for three weeks at Vassar Brothers Medical Center in Poughkeepsie before he woke up as thirsty as can be . He remembered feeling relief when someone gave him a popsicle in the hospital . After entering the hospital on March 20 , he stayed for 31 days before being transferred to a rehabilitation facility for further treatment . He finally went home to his wife , two of his four daughters and his `` son '' Harley , the family dog , on Thursday . He credits his recovery to the hospital staff and the support of his family . `` I want to believe I came back because I felt my family needed me , '' Scialpi said . His wife , Nyvette Reyes-Scialpi , and one of his daughters both tested positive for the virus , but did not exhibit symptoms nearly as bad as his . His spirits were high on Tuesday as he excitedly waited for the go-ahead to spring free from his month-long journey back to health . But he said it was bittersweet to leave the people who became like family at the hospital and rehab . `` You do n't see the people behind the mask , you see the character of who they really are , '' Scialpi said . Before becoming sick with the virus , Scialpi said he was not aware of his preexisting health conditions . When he got to the hospital , he also began treatment for hypertension and Lyme disease . He also developed a blood clot that was treated . He lost nearly 45 pounds while in the hospital , jokingly calling it the `` corona diet . '' What scares him and Miller most about their experience is the unknown of the virus . Most of the health professionals the two have worked with have told them there is still so much to learn about the virus ' effects on its victims . But both Miller and Scialpi said they were thankful to be survivors . `` I succeeded and I prevailed , and I 'm very grateful , '' Scialpi said . Miller made a Facebook group specifically for those in Orange and Rockland counties who have survived contracting COVID-19 . She said it has helped her find a community of others who have gone through a similar kind of nightmare .", "url": "https://www.recordonline.com/news/20200503/battling-and-beating-covid-19-mid-hudson-residents-share-their-stories", "kws": ["Mid-Hudson", "survivors", "Rockland", "Poughkeepsie", "Wallkill^^Miller", "family", "home", "severe^^condition", "symptoms", "man", "ventilators", "treatment", "nightmare", "Nicole^^Miller", "Montgomery", "Daniel^^Bennet", "Ellenville^^Scialpi", "Facebook", "health", "Easter^^Sunday"], "text_category": {"first_cat": {"Health": 0.5291836857795715}, "second_cat": {"Health_Other": 0.5291836857795715}}, "ne_content_person": {"Bennet": 1, "Robert Scialpi": 1, "Montgomery": 1, "Miller": 9, "Nyvette Reyes-Scialpi": 1, "Nicole Miller": 1, "Scialpi": 5, "Daniel Bennet": 1, "Wallkill Miller": 1, "Harley": 1}, "src": "Times Herald-Record", "c_word": 823, "para_count": 27.0, "para_length": 30.48148148148148, "image_count": 1, "geotag": [{"name": "hudson", "score": 0.9911932349205017, "coord": "42.252865,-73.790959", "pid": "hudson,new_york", "type": "city"}, {"name": "montgomery", "score": 0.9813262224197388, "coord": "41.527594,-74.236816", "pid": "montgomery,new_york", "type": "city"}, {"name": "new paltz", "score": 0.9635304808616638, "coord": "41.747593,-74.086810", "pid": "new_paltz,new_york", "type": "city"}], "title_c_count": 14}
